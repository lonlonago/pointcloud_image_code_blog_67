Unknowingly, it has been another 20 years, and this year it has been 44. Although I have retired at home, I have always maintained the habit of reading books. I read an average of 10 technical books every year to keep my skills from falling behind.

I have read no less than 200 technical books over the years. I will keep many good books at home and read them for a long time. Today, I recommend some of the best books to you. It is recommended that programmers read them. 

To borrow a phrase from the famous writer Bing Xin, "Read well, read more, read good books". 

In addition to the classic good books on programming languages, I will also introduce advanced books on algorithms and other aspects, hoping to help you.

###  C language books 

First of all, let's talk about C language books. This is also a question that many people ask me. What book is better to read in C language? I recommend this "C Prime Plus".

This book basically covers all aspects of the C language. I believe that many people have read Mr. Tan Haoqiang's textbook "C Programming". I have also read Mr. Tan's book many times, but in my experience, the book I recommend is much more comprehensive and deep, and it is very useful to read it several times.

For editions, it is recommended that you read the latest editions of books. Technical books often come out with new editions due to technological updates. Although the changes will not be significant, we should try our best to keep up with the latest technological trends. 

For the C language, you can read other books if you are advanced. There are two main aspects of the book, one is pointers and the other is memory. These two are the most important things in the C language. 

###  C++ books 

C++ + books I recommend to you two, one is a very classic "C++ Primer", the other is "C++ Primer Plus". 

![avatar]( dbcc1654b20e525fd3d2823c3594833f.png) 

The difference between the two books is that "C++ Primer Plus" is more suitable for people with zero foundation to read, because the content is more simple, if you have or read C++ things, or C language foundation is better, "C++ Primer" This book will be more suitable for you. 

###  Java books 

Java book I recommend "Java Programming Ideas", among all the Java books I have read, this is the most comprehensive and profound one, and it would be a pity to miss it. 

![avatar]( 20210529191812816.jpg) 

Of course, if you Java foundation is not very good, you may see that the back will be a little difficult, then you can start from the "Java core technology", it will be more appropriate, this book has volumes I and II, are very good.

If you want to use Java as a professional language, these 3 books are a must read. 

###  IV. Python books 

Nowadays, the number of people learning Python is increasing. Many friends are asking me online which book I should read to learn Python, so I recommend two books to everyone. 

The first book is "Fluent Python", which is a good Python book for intermediate and advanced programmers. 

![avatar]( 065dc4746aca4b12a256bf85d63ad480.jpeg) 

When you learn some Python and want to advance to advanced learning, "Fluent Python" is quite suitable. It will allow you to further understand Python from the bottom up. It basically does not involve entry-level content, but instead focuses on topics such as data models, data structures, function objects, object oriented, control flow, and metaprogramming. 

If you are a novice, don't read "Fluent Python". Instead, read "Python from Introduction to Practice". 

This is also one of Python's classic books. The content is easy to understand, and there is no problem for beginners to get started. It also includes many hands-on projects. As the title of the book says, you can learn from beginner to practical.

###  Go language books 

![avatar]( 20210529191924760.jpg) 

 GO Language would like to recommend a book I have been reading recently, "GO Language Practical Combat", also called "Go In Action". This book is translated from foreign books and is relatively thin, but it is very easy to understand. There are not many classic Go language books on the market. I think this book is good as an introductory book.  

###  Advanced 1: Data Structures and Algorithms Books 

When we have mastered one or two languages in C/C++/Java/Python/GO, and have already started, we will meet the first elements of finding a job, then we need to have a deep understanding of the more important IT technology in the IT industry, which will not only be involved in the interview, the interviewer will probe your technical depth, and will actually use it often in the work. 

For programming, in addition to language proficiency, the most important thing is data structures and algorithms. 

In this regard, I recommend the book "Introduction to Algorithms", which is not suitable for beginners because it requires a strong foundation in mathematics and a deep foundation in data structures and algorithms.

![avatar]( 20210529191959372.jpg) 

 Compared to the previous book, "Algorithms" is more acceptable and should be suitable for most friends who learn data structures and algorithms. This book covers the basic data structures and algorithms very comprehensively, and basically it can become a book for you to learn data structures and algorithms well.  

###  Advanced 2: Computer Network Books 

Computer networking is also a very important thing to find a job, and it is necessary to master it. In a narrow sense, computer networking is actually the TCP/IP protocol stack. 

First of all, I always think that the book "TCP/IP Explained in Detail" is my best book on computer networking or TCP/IP protocol stack. Although this book is very obscure and classic, it must be recommended. Of course, there is also a book "Computer Networking, Top Down". Looking at all the books on computer networking, I don't think there is any other better book than them, so you can choose one of them.

###  Step 3: Linux System Books 

One of the skills necessary to find a job is Linux operating system. As we all know, C language development is rarely done on Windows, basically based on Linux operating system. As an excellent programmer, it is essential to understand Linux. 

First of all, I recommend Brother Bird's "Linux Private Kitchen" to everyone. This book mainly talks about the use of Linux operating system, because it is the main command, which is very suitable for reference books. If you are basically familiar with the content inside, then you must be able to come in handy. You don't need to remember the details, but you need to know which command is for what. It is recommended that you read it again. 

![avatar]( 20210529192029658.jpg) 

"Linux private kitchen" is only about the use of Linux operating system, but if you want to learn to program on Linux operating system, it is recommended to see this book called "Unix environment advanced programming", C language is better, will not be in Linux operating system programming actual combat, then it is just a toy. 

"Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" will cover a lot of practical aspects, such as file IO, multi-threaded programming, networking, sockets, etc., making it very practical and classic.

###  Advanced 4: Code Quality Books 

Finally, I would like to recommend a book on code quality, which is also the book that has had the greatest impact on me. I have gained a lot of experience and skills from it, "Refactoring and Improving the Design of Existing Code". This book is about the best practice. Of course, you need to have a certain programming foundation. 

![avatar]( 20210529192126747.jpg) 

These books are all very classic, and I think they are almost all must-read technical books. If you finish reading them, finding a job should not be a problem. If you add some practical practices and open-source projects, then finding a good job is not a problem. I think I should have read many books when I was studying, so I share them with everyone and encourage them together. 

###  Conclusion 

Learning programming has never happened overnight. Those who tell you that they can master a language in a few days are all fooling people. 

I like Python very much, and I have collected a lot of technical dry goods, which can be shared with friends who like my articles. If you are willing to take the time to study, they will definitely help you. The dry goods include:
