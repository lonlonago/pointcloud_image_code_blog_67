Summary The for loop wants to count. It must be counted by means of range range (n): count from 0 to n. Does not contain n range (m, n): count from m to n, does not contain n range (m, n, s): count from m to n, does not contain n, the interval each time is s Usually used more for loops, while loops use more infinite loops
