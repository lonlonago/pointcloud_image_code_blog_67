Novices are prone to get stuck when writing code, especially when they come into contact with functions and other knowledge. They often don't know what method to use to implement it after reading the requirements. You may have the implementation logic, but you should forget what function to use. This is actually because the reserve of knowledge is not enough. You can't remember which function has any effect, so you are naturally confused. 

In the past few days, I have specially sorted out some commonly used functions in Python, from the most basic input and output functions to 12 sections such as regularization, a total of more than 100 commonly used functions, which is convenient for friends to quickly memorize, go through it quickly every day, and deepen it when using it. Slowly, you will get rid of the situation of writing code stuck. 

Although we emphasize more on understanding and actually typing code when teaching ourselves to program, there are some things you must keep in mind, otherwise you will be unable to write code. Of course, veterans have already memorized it. If a novice wants to develop quickly and easily, it is a good way to remember the functions used in high frequency.

Case: Judging the score according to the score entered by the user, when it is lower than 50 points, it prompts "your score is lower than 50 points", when it is lower than 50 points, it prompts "your score is around 60 points", if it is greater than or equal to 60 points, it is passed, 8090 points is excellent, and if it is greater than 90 points, it is very excellent.

Functions are more of a custom function, and there are not many commonly used built-in functions, mainly the following:

All the functions mentioned in the article have been organized into pictures. There are 6 of them. If necessary, you can chat with me privately. I will not repeat them here to increase the length of the article. The content is the same. You can also organize your own function notes. When we don't have a network or have a lot of favorites, as long as we have a mobile phone, we can access them without barriers, which is very convenient.

###  Conclusion 

The purpose of this article is not to teach you how to use functions, but to quickly and conveniently remember commonly used function names. Therefore, I did not give you an example of the usage of each function. Only after you have memorized the function name and its function will you have a clue. As for the usage of functions, Baidu will come out at once, and you will know it after a few uses. 

If you don't even know the name of the function and its purpose, you will have to spend more time and effort, and it will certainly be faster than if we look up the information with purpose. 

I can't help but think of 2010 when Python became the most popular language of the year, I started to learn Python (I used to use the main Java), just the function will remember dozens of pages of the book, commute to get off work are with me, take out the time to go through it quickly, and then have a colleague after work to eat supper and drink some wine, from the ground to the sky, the package is gone, the book is lost, the next day I regret... can only write a new one.

 To be honest, Python is a lot of fun, and it's not that cold anymore.
