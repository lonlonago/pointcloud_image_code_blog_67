 In the last lesson, we talked about opening the python interpreter and entering python. At this time, we can write code. Print (") This is the meaning of print. What you write will output. But think about it, if we want to write something every time we have to type it again, and if we want to run your code again, we have to reopen cmd and re-enter it. You can type 3 lines, 30 lines and 30,000 lines. You must not cry, so you have to save it in the file at this time. We can create a new text document on the desktop and file. If you haven't taken the computer test, just follow my picture, open my computer, find View, click the option in the upper right corner, click View, and uncheck the extension that hides known file types.

 Create a new text document and change the suffix to .py. Enter the content you want to type. Enter a python in front, and then drag the file directly into it, and you can execute it, but if you enter the wrong content in the file, the file will not remind you, so in the next lesson I will tell you a "The best power builder in the universe"
