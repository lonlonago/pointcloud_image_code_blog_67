Many people think that by learning several parsing libraries such as the urlib module and xpath, they will become proficient in crawling after learning Selenium, but when they go outside and want to rely on crawling technology to connect privately, they find it difficult to do anything. 

Uncle Long, I have been a programmer for nearly 20 years, and today I will tell you what a real crawler master should learn. Even if you have no foundation, you can still know how to learn.

Without further ado, let's get straight to the point. 

###  1. Language basics Python 

There are many tools that can be used to make crawlers, but the most convenient language in the industry is Python. So if you want to learn Python to learn crawlers, how much should you learn? 

Here are some essential Python knowledge points for you. You don't need to learn more or less. Basically, you can get it done in a week or two.

###  2. Crawler basics and common modules 

After the language foundation is laid, we can officially enter the learning of crawlers. 

The first thing you should learn is the basics of crawlers, such as: 

With a general understanding of crawlers, you can start learning from the commonly used modules. Urllib and request are two modules that crawlers must learn, such as refer and status code. You need to know what status your program requests return, whether it succeeds or fails. 

In this part, you should learn how to make your program simulate user actions and automatically send requests to websites or other objects, which is more basic. 

Why is it very basic? Because many websites are validated, it is necessary to learn Selenium, a very commonly used tool that simulates artificial browser behavior, which is effective in verification.

###  3. Analysis library 

After learning to simulate user behavior and send requests to crawler objects, we must learn to parse what we get, otherwise we will get a bunch of garbled characters, and Jesus will be confused when he sees it.

  So what are the things that the parsing library needs to master? These are very important: 

###  4. Scrapy framework 

What is a framework? It is equivalent to a structure that encapsulates many functions. It helps us build the main structure, and we only need to add content to the skeleton. 

Scrapy framework is a framework for crawling website data and extracting data. We are familiar with the four major parts of crawlers, including request, response, parsing, and storage. The scrapy framework has been established. 

So what does Scrapy need to learn?

 After learning to use the framework, the crawler can save a lot of time without having to write all the functions by hand. Why not?  

###  5. Databases 

For a master crawler, a database is also a must. If it is an enterprise crawler, you know the data you crawl down, but if you want to call it for others, it is mostly sorted out and stored in the database for easy access. 

So what do you need to learn about databases? Whether it is SQL or NOSQL database, at least you need to know one, either MySQL or MongoDB, depending on your situation.

###  6. Mobile end crawler 

Many small partners stop at only crawling web data, and are helpless about mobile data. This is actually a typical crawling technology that has not yet arrived.

  So what do mobile end crawlers need to learn? Let me list it for you:

###  7. Improvement of crawler technology 

If you know the previous techniques, you can handle at least 60% of the crawler objects, but with the continuous improvement of the anti-crawler mechanism, many crawler objects now give themselves multiple city walls, so the difference between ordinary crawlers and crawler masters lies in high-end technology. 

If you want to become a master crawler, you also need to learn the following aspects: 

If the same IP frequently crawls the specified object, it will most likely be detected as a crawler, so IP proxies and coding platforms must be able to do so. 

Nowadays, CAPTCHAs are increasingly testing IQ, so we also need to master this area, such as speed algorithms, OpenCV, and behavioral verification technologies.

What is font anti-crawling? 

Simply put, font anti-crawl refers to the characters on the browser page and the content in the debugging window or source code, which are displayed differently, which is font anti-crawl. 

The complex point is that web developers create a font by themselves, because each text in the font has its own code, so the final effect of the text will not be directly displayed in the web page in the future, but its code name will be displayed, so even if the text content in the web page is obtained, it is only the code name of the text, not the text itself. 

Therefore, this technology can also be used as a direction for improvement. 

For the sake of data security, modern websites/apps usually encrypt data interfaces. The process of analyzing the encryption algorithms of these interfaces and implementing simulated calls is called reverse. 

Reverse is a topic that can never be avoided for crawler engineers, and it has gradually become a must-have skill requirement in JD when recruiting companies. 

###  Conclusion 

Finally, let me summarize all the techniques mentioned in the article, which are listed in the following crawler learning roadmap:

  If you can learn more than 90% of the technology stacks mentioned above, then you can become a master crawler. 

Technology is innocent, but behavior can be sentenced. I hope everyone can use it on the right path after mastering the real technology.
