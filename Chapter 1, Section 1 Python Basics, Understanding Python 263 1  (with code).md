1. What is programming? It is easy to understand. Programming is the use of code to write programs. There are many ways to write programs, such as C language, Java Python language, and many other languages.

  2. What is a programming language? A programming language is a language for writing programs, and which syntax rules are used to write programs. Then, many programming prefaces need our programmers' hands to type them out one by one. For example, "a = 10" Imagine, 'a = 10' is something we humans know, but to turn it into something the computer knows, the computer knows the '01 'code! This problem arises, we need to convert what we know into '01' code and hand it over to the machine to execute. At this time, it is divided into two categories of programming languages: 

The first category: compile type (c, go): compile type is to translate the program you wrote into 01 code at one time, compile type is characterized by high execution efficiency, like you play League of Legends (Lol), Dungeons and Warriors (Dnf) are basically compiled language to write (c language), so c language is also a typical compile type, do you want to play lol in the Linux, shouting Demacia with Galen, not no, it is very troublesome, so compile type also has a feature of his platform dependence is very high

 The second category: interpretive (java, python): interpretive is just the opposite of the compiled type, translating and running the source code line by line, you can send the code you wrote directly to your customers, your customers can directly execute your program with software, you think about it. You send the code you wrote directly to your customers. When your customers run, they need to translate line by line, translate line by line, and run line by line. At this time, the execution efficiency is relatively low. Therefore, the characteristic of interpretive is that the execution efficiency is relatively low, and the platform dependence is not high. 3. What is python, the advantages and disadvantages of python. Python's past life originated from the originator "Uncle Turtle". In 1989, Guido van Rossum decided to develop a new script interpreter in Amsterdam to pass the boring Christmas. Since then, Python and its founder "Uncle Turtle" have entered the public eye. He hopes that this new language, called Python, will meet his ideal: to create a language between C and shell, with comprehensive functions, easy to learn, easy to use, and extensible. Chinese translation: Python, his Chinese translation should not be torn. Python has nothing to do with python. It is just a random start by foreigners, and they can do whatever they want. Python language is old, but only in recent years, with the emergence of artificial intelligence and data analytics big data platforms, python has become popular with its unique advantages. It is a scripting language. It is very good for processing data, writing a crawler, and writing some small functions. It is particularly easy to get started, especially easy, and the third library is particularly comprehensive. So as people's demand for the era of big data has increased one by one in recent years, python has also risen with the tide, and it has become a big hit. Python's characteristics: crawler, automation (automated office, automated operation and maintenance) scientific computing artificial intelligence 

Python is an object-oriented, interpreted, and weakly typed scripting language, and it is also a powerful and well-developed general-purpose language.
