A few days ago, I went to a friend's company to do technical guidance, and I found a very interesting thing. Their IDLEs are all thieves. According to them, writing code in this way doesn't have to stare at some letters, numbers, and symbols all day, and it's no longer so boring. As a developer for more than ten years, IDLE has always used the default interface of the system, which really makes me feel ashamed after a closer look. 

I went back and thought about it. I think I can write an article to share with you. The IDLE of these developers is really interesting. I asked them to take a few representative interface diagrams. Let's take a look at what their pycharm looks like. 

So here's an example.

 Here's another one.

 I heard that it is a relatively popular anime in China. I have never seen it. I rarely go to anime, and I don't like to watch it very much. 

The IDLE background of a female programmer in their company has also changed, which I guess may have been motivated by them.

 Among them, I have seen the most special one. He said it was his girlfriend. I took a look at his appearance and background. The little sister didn't speak. In fact, I was skeptical:

It's really interesting to change the style of IDLE, but their style is still not suitable for me. At my age, I may prefer some artistic things, which may seem a bit low in everyone's eyes, but I think it's okay.

Next, I will share with you how to change the background of your pycharm, and three steps will make your IDLE unique. 

##  First, the operation steps 

The first step is to open pycharm, click File, and select Settings.

In the second step, click Appearance in the Appearance & Behavior option, and click Background Image.

The third step is to click on the "..." place in the upper right corner, and you can choose the picture you want to use as the background. After confirming, choose the display method you like. I think the second method is still good.

The last thing is to set the brightness of the background image. I suggest that the brighter background should be about the same at 10% transparency. If it is too bright, it will affect the code, personal preference and picture color.

Thank you to everyone who read my article carefully. Watching the rise and attention of fans all the way, there is always a need for reciprocity. Although it is not a very valuable thing, you can take it away if you can use it. 

① More than 2,000 Python e-books (both mainstream and classic books should be available) 

② Python standard library information (the most complete Chinese version) 

③ Project source code (40 or 50 interesting and classic practice projects and source code) 

④ Videos on Python basics, crawling, web development, and big data analytics (suitable for Xiaobai learning) 

⑤ Python learning roadmap (bid farewell to undercurrent learning) 

In my QQ technical exchange group, you can take it away by yourself. If you encounter problems in your studies or work, there will be some great gods in the group to help you answer them. Sometimes, if you think about it for a day, you might as well be enlightened by someone else's words. Group number 1044939456.
