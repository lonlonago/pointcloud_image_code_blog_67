Some people can't get in after learning Python for two or three months, while others can start their own projects in about a month. When I was a beginner in Python, it only took me more than a month to become familiar with crawlers and data analytics. Of course, I am an old programmer, so I can learn other languages faster. 

Therefore, I will use some of my experiences and resources to share with you the pits I have fallen into, hoping that you can step over them. 

Let me share with you six useful things, some of which are my own tutorials and routes, and some are collectible video tutorials. With them, your Python journey will be easier and more enjoyable. 

Let me introduce how to use these things first, and take them away at the end of the article.

(1) The learning path in all directions of Python (new version) 

This is where I spent a few days sorting out the technical points in all directions of Python to form a summary of knowledge points in various fields. Its usefulness is that you can follow the above knowledge points to find corresponding learning resources to ensure that you learn more comprehensively. 

Recently, I have made a new update to these routes, and the knowledge system is more comprehensive.

(2) Python learning videos 

It contains more than 100 learning videos on Python beginners, crawlers, data analytics, and web development. Although it is not as comprehensive, it is no problem for beginners. After learning these, you can follow my learning route to find other knowledge resources online to advance.

(3) More than 100 practice projects 

When we watch videos to learn, we can't just use our eyes and brains without doing anything. The more scientific learning method is to use them after understanding. At this time, the practice project is very suitable, but there are many projects in it, and the level is also uneven. You can choose the projects you can do to practice.

(4) More than 200 e-books. Over the years, I have also collected a lot of e-books, probably more than 200. Sometimes it is inconvenient to bring physical books, so I will open the e-books to have a look. Books are not necessarily worse than video tutorials, especially authoritative technical books. 

Basically, there are both mainstream and classic ones. I will not put pictures here. There is no problem with copyright issues. 

(5) Summary of Python knowledge points 

The summary of knowledge points is a bit like a learning route, but the difference from the learning route is that the summary of knowledge points is more detailed, including a simple description of specific knowledge points, while our learning route is more abstract and simple, just to make it easier for everyone to learn which technology stacks you should learn in a certain field.

(6) Other information 

There are also some other things, such as my own Python introductory graphic tutorial, which allows me to learn knowledge without a computer, learn theory and then go to code practice verification, as well as the Chinese version of Python library materials, MySQL and HTML tags, etc. These are all things that can be given to fans.

These are not very valuable things, but they are really good for learners who do not have resources or are not very good. If you use them, you can just take them away. Anyone who has followed me knows that these are all available.

Finally, I wish you success in your studies, and don't spray if you don't like it.
