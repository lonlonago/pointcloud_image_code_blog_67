I originally didn't like playing games, but recently my brother had something to do and put his grandson at my house for us to help take care of. My little nephew loves to play games very much. He is in his early sixties and seventies, and he stares at Honor of Kings every day, which is really a headache. 

Then I thought of a way to use Python to change the game of Xiaoxiao, add a layer of Honor of Kings "skin", confiscate his phone, and let him play this game that can slightly exercise his intelligence.

These games are written in Python. I used to collect some games. I don't think the middle setting is very good, so I changed it according to my personal preference. I will share it with you today. If you have nothing to do, you can play for entertainment. Or if you want to make small games, you can refer to them. 

There is a network disk link at the end of the article, which can be picked up by yourself if necessary. 

###  The Honor of Kings 

Like the usual Xiaoxiao, three identical patterns can be eliminated together, and as much as possible, more identical patterns can be eliminated within the specified time to get a higher score.

To be honest, I play this game with my grandnephew, but I really can't play him, his eyes are too sharp. 

###  Gobang 

Xiaoxiao Le, I can't play him, so I made a special one that I am good at, Gobang, I started playing this thing when I was ten years old, and this little brat has never won with me, hahaha.

###  III. Tank War 

Tank Wars was a classic old game that could be played by two people together. The only drawback was that when they designed it, they always felt that the shells hit the wall strangely, but they didn't want to fix it.

###  Fourth, eat peas 

The rules of this game were that players could clear the level by eating all the yellow Doudou without being caught by the ghosts of the system. Although the ghosts of the system looked stupid, to be honest, I couldn't pass the first level, but that little brat could.

###  Fifth, Google Dinosaur 

This game is to imitate the little dinosaur game that appears when the Chrome browser is disconnected from the network. Through the space bar to control the forward dinosaur, it will fail to encounter flying objects or plants. The more plants and flying objects the little dinosaur avoids, the higher the score.

###  The game source code needs to be picked up by yourself:

Extraction code: lg8d 

My little nephew stayed at my house for a week, and every night when I had nothing to do, I would take him to play this game. At first, he was quite stubborn when he was not allowed to play mobile games. After playing Python games with me, he became attached to me. In fact, I did not simply ask him to change from one game to another, but when he became familiar with the game, I would simply share some of the internal principles of the game with him. 

Of course, he doesn't understand the code, and I won't tell him the code. I just tell him how the game is designed and what some essential things are, so that he doesn't get fascinated by the shell of the game.

And I came home one day, and this guy actually opened up my computer, found the source files, and he was secretly changing the parameters because he wanted to make the game easier.
