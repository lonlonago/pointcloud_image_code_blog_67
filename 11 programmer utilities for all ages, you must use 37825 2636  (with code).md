The reason why a good programmer is excellent is not necessarily that he can write code faster than everyone else, but he must be more efficient at solving things than many people. The way to improve work efficiency does not require us to be proficient in all 18 martial arts. Sometimes using good tools can help us greatly improve work efficiency. 

Today, I would like to share with you 11 tools that programmers recommend collecting. They are suitable for all ages, especially novice programmers. Their technical level may be difficult to improve for a while, and they need to study and practice persistently. However, with good use of tools, their efficiency can be improved rapidly.

###  CSDN browser assistant (a must-have browser plug-in for developers) 

This is a browser plug-in officially launched by CSDN, and it is also a relatively good tool that I have been using. I have not received any official money here. I sincerely recommend it. There are two points that have kept me using it. The first is that after using it, not only can you customize the browser background, but also remove a lot of information and advertisements, leaving a simple search function. This function also supports search methods such as Baidu and Google. 

Shouldn't the browser just return to the essence of search? Why do you need so many other things? Wouldn't it be better to watch news and information on a more professional and lively platform? If there is something, it should also be development related, so I really like it.

  Secondly, it is also rich in auxiliary tools, such as quick generation of free QR codes, JSON tools, IP queries, translation and plug-in management, etc. Especially when you switch to the old version, you will find that there are many resources available, which is no different from a small treasure!

###  Vscode (the editor most developers use) 

This is a code and text editor that most developers use, featuring plugin-rich, cross-platform, easy-to-use, and open-source features. Some even say it is omnipotent. 

For example, it supports the integration of multiple programming languages, whether it is Java, C, Python or C++, etc., you can run scripts, compile, debug and other operations in the editor; for example, it supports operating systems such as Windows, Linux and macOS and open source code; for example, it supports testing, and has built-in Git version control functions and development environment functions, such as code completion (similar to IntelliSense), code snippets and code refactoring, etc. 

The power of VS Code has also made it the most popular power builder many times, which would be a pity if you didn't give it a try.

###  XMind (Mind Map) 

Xmind is a software that is more suitable for recording ideas, especially when you are in charge of a project. It can refine and display all aspects of the project without a lot of text to describe it, and it can also reflect personal careful logic. It is a rather good tool, and I have been using it all the time. 

However, this also has a free version and a paid version. Generally, the free version is sufficient.

###  MobaXterm (remote end point login tool) 

MobaXterm is an enhanced end point, X server, and Unix command set (GNU/Cygwin) toolkit that supports SSH connections, FTP, serial ports, and more. 

MobaXterm can open multiple end point windows, based on the latest X server-based X.Org, and can easily use GNU Unix commands on Unix/Linux. This way, we can use virtual environments without installing virtual machines, and then use most linux commands just through MobaXterm. MobaXterm also has strong extensibility, and can integrate plug-ins to run programs such as Gcc, Perl, Curl, Tcl/Tk/Expect.

###  Typora (pure markdow editor) 

As a programmer, it is inevitable to write documents. Whether it is a work document or an article written by yourself, you need to use editing software. Compared with more outside, such as Tencent Online Documents, Kingsoft Documents, etc., I recommend Typora, which is a pure markdow editor. The interface brief is ad-free and highly supportive. Good files are uploaded directly on many platforms, such as our CSDN, Jianshu, Nuggets, Bobakerpark, etc. Developers often visit websites that are almost popular in the industry. 

If you want to write documentation, then I think you can try Typora, a pure open-source software that I don't know how many years I've been using.

###  LingMax (developer artifact library) 

This can be called a developer's artifact library, which includes DNS acceleration (optimization/hijacking/release, etc.), HTTP requests, network packet capture, file processing (JSON visualization/regular matching, etc.), tool repositories (API requests, etc.), script repositories, etc. There are many gadgets in it, and it is also a rare auxiliary artifact for developers.

###  IDEA REST Client (interface debugging) 

Anyone who has done interface debugging must know mail carrier, but if you have used IDEA REST Client, you will say "goodbye" to mail carrier. 

IDEA REST Client has all the features of mail carrier, but there are also features that mail carrier does not have. For example, REST Client supports cURL and RFC 2616 standards to call REST APIs. Secondly, if you can complete development and debugging in one production tool, why switch to another tool?

###  FSCapture (image processing tool) 

This is a very small and practical tool for screenshots, editing and screen recording. It supports scrolling screenshots, picture editing and modification, and screen recording in various ways. How small is it? The entire file is about 5M, and it can be used directly after downloading from the network disk, without installing it.

  I can't find its official website. This kind of software on Baidu has been occupied by other SEOs. Let me share the resources I have been saving on the network disk.

###  Everything (the strongest document search artifact) 

Everyone's computer keeps a large number of software, MP3s, photos, games, documents, e-books and other files. If you don't have good usage habits and management methods, things will easily get messy over time. It may take you most of the day to find a document, which can be quite embarrassing when it is urgent. 

But Everthing can find the files you need from a massive hard drive in a lightning-fast, incredibly fast! It's so much faster than the file search that comes with your computer, and you'll love it after trying it.

###  Tinder (computer without ads) 

Tinder should be used by many people, right? Yes, like everyone else, I like its ad blocking function. As long as you install it, your computer can hardly see ads, and it will automatically block them. Even if there is an ad popping up, it will not pop up for more than 1 second. 

![avatar]( 6fbcc7fc7d6d4c378f10170f41a614be.png) 

  Especially when there is a bug in the code and you are scratching your hair to debug, a pop-up advertisement can really make the popularity burst. We can open the "pop-up blocking" of Tinder to see, this thing really does a lot for you when you don't find it.

###  Navicat Premium (a visualization tool for database management) 

When I work with databases, I often use Navicat, a set of database management tools designed to simplify database management and reduce system administration costs. Database management and development is a complex task, but Navicat simplifies database management and development with a graphical user interface that makes it safe and simple to create, organize, access, and share information. 

Navicat Premium can easily and quickly transfer data between various database systems, or transfer a plain text file in a specified SQL format and encoding. Other features include import wizard, export wizard, query creation tool, report creation tool, data synchronization, backup, work schedule, and more. 

With it, your database development will be at ease.

###  Conclusion 

It doesn't mean that these 11 kinds of power builders are recommended to be installed, and you can install what you need. For example, if you don't usually use the interface to debug, then it doesn't make sense for you to install the IDEA REST Client. However, it is meaningful for you to collect my article. One day you come into contact with that aspect of things, turn out the article and take a look. You know all the tools that work. 

There are many useful tools for programmers. If you have any that you like, please leave a comment to share and communicate.
