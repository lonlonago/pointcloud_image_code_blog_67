Many people can't do anything after learning Python for two or three months, but some people can start their own projects or private work after learning it for less than a month. Why is this?

As a 20-year-old programmer, Uncle Long, I think that in addition to internal reasons, learning resources occupy the majority. Having good learning resources can indeed save you a lot of detours on the road to learning. 

So today, I will hand over all my private resources and corresponding learning methods to you, for nothing else, just give me a like if you pass by, thank you! 

I will talk about resources and learning methods first, and I will leave the way I picked up the dry goods at the end of the article. 

I spent a long time sorting out the technical points required by various Python positions on the market, and combined with my nearly 20 years of coding career, I have summarized the technical stacks that should be learned in various directions such as Python crawlers and data analytics. 

I think this is very important. If you know how to proceed from the beginning, you will avoid many detours along the way.

For example, in the case of crawlers, many people think that they are proficient in Python crawlers after learning several parsing libraries such as xpath and PyQuery. In fact, there is still a long way to go, such as mobile end crawlers and JS reverse.

Contains Python introductory, crawling, data analytics and web development learning videos, a total of more than 100, although not up to the boss level, but proficiency in Python is no problem, after learning these, you can follow my learning route to find other knowledge resources online for advanced.

When we watch videos to learn, we can't just use our eyes and brains without doing anything. The more scientific learning method is to use them after understanding. At this time, the practice project is very suitable, but there are many projects in it, and the level is also uneven. You can choose the projects you can do to practice.

Over the years, I have also collected a lot of e-books, probably more than 200. Sometimes, if it is inconvenient to bring physical books, I will open the e-books to have a look. Books are not necessarily worse than video tutorials, especially authoritative technical books.

Basically, there are both mainstream and classic ones. I will not put pictures here. There is no problem with copyright issues. 

There are other things, such as my own Python introductory graphic tutorial, which is different from other people's articles. My graphic tutorial will be more interesting, and sometimes you may laugh out loud when you look at it. When it is inconvenient to watch videos, you can also learn Python by reading books.

I've always wanted to make learning programming more enjoyable. 

These are not very valuable things, but they are really good for learners who do not have resources or are not very good. If you use them, you can just take them away. Anyone who has followed me knows that these are all available. 

###  How to take it away?

Finally, I wish you success in your studies, and don't spray if you don't like it.
