The reason why a good programmer is excellent is not necessarily that he can write code faster than everyone else, but he must be more efficient at solving things than many people. The way to improve work efficiency does not require us to be proficient in all 18 martial arts. Sometimes using good tools can help us greatly improve work efficiency. 

Today, I would like to share with you 11 tools that programmers recommend collecting. They are suitable for all ages, especially novice programmers. Their technical level may be difficult to improve for a while, and they need to study and practice persistently. However, with good use of tools, their efficiency can be improved rapidly.

###  CSDN browser assistant (a must-have browser plug-in for developers) 

This is a browser plug-in officially launched by CSDN, and it is also a relatively good tool that I have been using. I have not received any official money here. I sincerely recommend it. There are two points that have kept me using it. The first is that after using it, not only can you customize the browser background, but also remove a lot of information and advertisements, leaving a simple search function. This function also supports search methods such as Baidu and Google. 

Shouldn't the browser just return to the essence of search? Why do you need so many other things? Wouldn't it be better to watch news and information on a more professional and lively platform? If there is something, it should also be development related, so I really like it.

  Secondly, it is also rich in auxiliary tools, such as quick generation of free QR codes, JSON tools, IP queries, translation and plug-in management, etc. Especially when you switch to the old version, you will find that there are many resources available, which is no different from a small treasure!

###  Vscode (the editor most developers use) 

This is a code and text editor that most developers use, featuring plugin-rich, cross-platform, easy-to-use, and open-source features. Some even say it is omnipotent. 

For example, it supports the integration of multiple programming languages, whether it is Java, C, Python or C++, etc., you can run scripts, compile, debug and other operations in the editor; for example, it supports operating systems such as Windows, Linux and macOS and open source code; for example, it supports testing, and has built-in Git version control functions and development environment functions, such as code completion (similar to IntelliSense), code snippets and code refactoring, etc. 

The power of VS Code has also made it the most popular power builder many times, which would be a pity if you didn't give it a try.

###  XMind (Mind Map) 

Xmind is a software that is more suitable for recording ideas, especially when you are in charge of a project. It can refine and display all aspects of the project without a lot of text to describe it, and it can also reflect personal careful logic. It is a rather good tool, and I have been using it all the time. 

However, this also has a free version and a paid version. Generally, the free version is sufficient.

###  MobaXterm (remote end point login tool) 

MobaXterm is an enhanced end point, X server, and Unix command set (GNU/Cygwin) toolkit that supports SSH connections, FTP, serial ports, and more. 

MobaXterm can open multiple end point windows, based on the latest X server-based X.Org, and can easily use GNU Unix commands on Unix/Linux. This way, we can use virtual environments without installing virtual machines, and then use most linux commands just through MobaXterm. MobaXterm also has strong extensibility, and can integrate plug-ins to run programs such as Gcc, Perl, Curl, Tcl/Tk/Expect.

###  Typora (pure markdow editor) 

As a programmer, it is inevitable to write documents. Whether it is a work document or an article written by yourself, you need to use editing software. Compared with more outside, such as Tencent Online Documents, Kingsoft Documents, etc., I recommend Typora, which is a pure markdow editor. The interface brief is ad-free and highly supportive. Good files are uploaded directly on many platforms, such as our CSDN, Jianshu, Nuggets, Bobakerpark, etc. Developers often visit websites that are almost popular in the industry. 

If you want to write documentation, then I think you can try Typora, a pure open-source software that I don't know how many years I've been using.

###  LingMax (developer artifact library) 

This can be called a developer's artifact library, which includes DNS acceleration (optimization/hijacking/release, etc.), HTTP requests, network packet capture, file processing (JSON visualization/regular matching, etc.), tool repositories (API requests, etc.), script repositories, etc. There are many gadgets in it, and it is also a rare auxiliary artifact for developers.

###  IDEA REST Client (interface debugging) 

Anyone who has done interface debugging must know mail carrier, but if you have used IDEA REST Client, you will say "goodbye" to mail carrier. 

IDEA REST Client has all the features of mail carrier, but there are also features that mail carrier does not have. For example, REST Client supports cURL and RFC 2616 standards to call REST APIs. Secondly, if you can complete development and debugging in one production tool, why switch to another tool?

###  FSCapture (image processing tool) 

This is a very small and practical tool for screenshots, editing and screen recording. It supports scrolling screenshots, picture editing and modification, and screen recording in various ways. How small is it? The entire file is about 5M, and it can be used directly after downloading from the network disk, without installing it. 

![avatar]( b80515c9184349faac2afdffde89a941.gif) 

  I can't find its official website. This kind of software on Baidu has been occupied by other SEOs. Let me share the resources I have been saving on the network disk.

###  Everything (the strongest document search artifact) 

Everyone's computer keeps a large number of software, MP3s, photos, games, documents, e-books and other files. If you don't have good usage habits and management methods, things will easily get messy over time. It may take you most of the day to find a document, which can be quite embarrassing when it is urgent. 

But Everthing can find the files you need from a massive hard drive in a lightning-fast, incredibly fast! It's so much faster than the file search that comes with your computer, and you'll love it after trying it.

###  Tinder (computer without ads) 

Tinder should be used by many people, right? Yes, like everyone else, I like its ad blocking function. As long as you install it, your computer can hardly see ads, and it will automatically block them. Even if there is an ad popping up, it will not pop up for more than 1 second. 

![avatar]( 6fbcc7fc7d6d4c378f10170f41a614be.png) 

  Especially when there is a bug in the code and you are scratching your hair to debug, a pop-up advertisement can really make the popularity burst. We can open the "pop-up blocking" of Tinder to see, this thing really does a lot for you when you don't find it.

###  Navicat Premium (a visualization tool for database management) 

When I work with databases, I often use Navicat, a set of database management tools designed to simplify database management and reduce system administration costs. Database management and development is a complex task, but Navicat simplifies database management and development with a graphical user interface that makes it safe and simple to create, organize, access, and share information. 

Navicat Premium can easily and quickly transfer data between various database systems, or transfer a plain text file in a specified SQL format and encoding. Other features include import wizard, export wizard, query creation tool, report creation tool, data synchronization, backup, work schedule, and more. 

With it, your database development will be at ease.

###  Conclusion 

It doesn't mean that these 11 kinds of power builders are recommended to be installed, and you can install what you need. For example, if you don't usually use the interface to debug, then it doesn't make sense for you to install the IDEA REST Client. However, it is meaningful for you to collect my article. One day you come into contact with that aspect of things, turn out the article and take a look. You know all the tools that work. 

There are many useful tools for programmers. If you have any that you like, please leave a comment to share and communicate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unknowingly, it has been another 20 years, and this year it has been 44. Although I have retired at home, I have always maintained the habit of reading books. I read an average of 10 technical books every year to keep my skills from falling behind. 

![avatar]( 20210529194238120.jpg) 

I have read no less than 200 technical books over the years. I will keep many good books at home and read them for a long time. Today, I recommend some of the best books to you. It is recommended that programmers read them. 

To borrow a phrase from the famous writer Bing Xin, "Read well, read more, read good books". 

In addition to the classic good books on programming languages, I will also introduce advanced books on algorithms and other aspects, hoping to help you. 

>  The books involved in this article have been negotiated with the publisher and are for technical exchange only, without consumption or other guidance, and are for reference only. 

###  C language books 

First of all, let's talk about C language books. This is also a question that many people ask me. What book is better to read in C language? I recommend this "C Prime Plus". 

![avatar]( 053b52c3309c46d0a102b7db94868890.jpeg) 

This book basically covers all aspects of the C language. I believe that many people have read Mr. Tan Haoqiang's textbook "C Programming". I have also read Mr. Tan's book many times, but in my experience, the book I recommend is much more comprehensive and deep, and it is very useful to read it several times. 

![avatar]( 20210529191731295.png) 

For editions, it is recommended that you read the latest editions of books. Technical books often come out with new editions due to technological updates. Although the changes will not be significant, we should try our best to keep up with the latest technological trends. 

For the C language, you can read other books if you are advanced. There are two main aspects of the book, one is pointers and the other is memory. These two are the most important things in the C language. 

###  C++ books 

C++ + books I recommend to you two, one is a very classic "C++ Primer", the other is "C++ Primer Plus". 

![avatar]( dbcc1654b20e525fd3d2823c3594833f.png) 

The difference between the two books is that "C++ Primer Plus" is more suitable for people with zero foundation to read, because the content is more simple, if you have or read C++ things, or C language foundation is better, "C++ Primer" This book will be more suitable for you. 

###  Java books 

Java book I recommend "Java Programming Ideas", among all the Java books I have read, this is the most comprehensive and profound one, and it would be a pity to miss it. 

![avatar]( 20210529191812816.jpg) 

Of course, if you Java foundation is not very good, you may see that the back will be a little difficult, then you can start from the "Java core technology", it will be more appropriate, this book has volumes I and II, are very good. 

![avatar]( c3a3ca0f3c880a0bf41466e1155d52bf.png) 

If you want to use Java as a professional language, these 3 books are a must read. 

###  IV. Python books 

Nowadays, the number of people learning Python is increasing. Many friends are asking me online which book I should read to learn Python, so I recommend two books to everyone. 

The first book is "Fluent Python", which is a good Python book for intermediate and advanced programmers. 

![avatar]( 065dc4746aca4b12a256bf85d63ad480.jpeg) 

When you learn some Python and want to advance to advanced learning, "Fluent Python" is quite suitable. It will allow you to further understand Python from the bottom up. It basically does not involve entry-level content, but instead focuses on topics such as data models, data structures, function objects, object oriented, control flow, and metaprogramming. 

If you are a novice, don't read "Fluent Python". Instead, read "Python from Introduction to Practice". 

This is also one of Python's classic books. The content is easy to understand, and there is no problem for beginners to get started. It also includes many hands-on projects. As the title of the book says, you can learn from beginner to practical. 

![avatar]( 20210529191901179.jpg) 

###  Go language books 

![avatar]( 20210529191924760.jpg) 

 GO Language would like to recommend a book I have been reading recently, "GO Language Practical Combat", also called "Go In Action". This book is translated from foreign books and is relatively thin, but it is very easy to understand. There are not many classic Go language books on the market. I think this book is good as an introductory book.  

###  Advanced 1: Data Structures and Algorithms Books 

When we have mastered one or two languages in C/C++/Java/Python/GO, and have already started, we will meet the first elements of finding a job, then we need to have a deep understanding of the more important IT technology in the IT industry, which will not only be involved in the interview, the interviewer will probe your technical depth, and will actually use it often in the work. 

For programming, in addition to language proficiency, the most important thing is data structures and algorithms. 

In this regard, I recommend the book "Introduction to Algorithms", which is not suitable for beginners because it requires a strong foundation in mathematics and a deep foundation in data structures and algorithms. 

![avatar]( 20210529191945340.jpg) 

![avatar]( 20210529191959372.jpg) 

 Compared to the previous book, "Algorithms" is more acceptable and should be suitable for most friends who learn data structures and algorithms. This book covers the basic data structures and algorithms very comprehensively, and basically it can become a book for you to learn data structures and algorithms well.  

###  Advanced 2: Computer Network Books 

Computer networking is also a very important thing to find a job, and it is necessary to master it. In a narrow sense, computer networking is actually the TCP/IP protocol stack. 

First of all, I always think that the book "TCP/IP Explained in Detail" is my best book on computer networking or TCP/IP protocol stack. Although this book is very obscure and classic, it must be recommended. Of course, there is also a book "Computer Networking, Top Down". Looking at all the books on computer networking, I don't think there is any other better book than them, so you can choose one of them. 

![avatar]( 9b41dd0086aa22c3272ba8fab7593acf.png) 

###  Step 3: Linux System Books 

One of the skills necessary to find a job is Linux operating system. As we all know, C language development is rarely done on Windows, basically based on Linux operating system. As an excellent programmer, it is essential to understand Linux. 

First of all, I recommend Brother Bird's "Linux Private Kitchen" to everyone. This book mainly talks about the use of Linux operating system, because it is the main command, which is very suitable for reference books. If you are basically familiar with the content inside, then you must be able to come in handy. You don't need to remember the details, but you need to know which command is for what. It is recommended that you read it again. 

![avatar]( 20210529192029658.jpg) 

"Linux private kitchen" is only about the use of Linux operating system, but if you want to learn to program on Linux operating system, it is recommended to see this book called "Unix environment advanced programming", C language is better, will not be in Linux operating system programming actual combat, then it is just a toy. 

"Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" will cover a lot of practical aspects, such as file IO, multi-threaded programming, networking, sockets, etc., making it very practical and classic. 

![avatar]( 20210529192106450.jpg) 

###  Advanced 4: Code Quality Books 

Finally, I would like to recommend a book on code quality, which is also the book that has had the greatest impact on me. I have gained a lot of experience and skills from it, "Refactoring and Improving the Design of Existing Code". This book is about the best practice. Of course, you need to have a certain programming foundation. 

![avatar]( 20210529192126747.jpg) 

These books are all very classic, and I think they are almost all must-read technical books. If you finish reading them, finding a job should not be a problem. If you add some practical practices and open-source projects, then finding a good job is not a problem. I think I should have read many books when I was studying, so I share them with everyone and encourage them together. 

###  Conclusion 

Learning programming has never happened overnight. Those who tell you that they can master a language in a few days are all fooling people. 

I like Python very much, and I have collected a lot of technical dry goods, which can be shared with friends who like my articles. If you are willing to take the time to study, they will definitely help you. The dry goods include:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few days ago, while chatting with a young man, he discovered a problem. He started learning Python from scratch, and after learning the basics of lists, dictionaries, and functions, he began to advance in the direction of crawlers. As a result, it took him more than a month to learn nothing, but it was difficult to move an inch. 

![avatar]( 60d267e152ca45608ca33d14e67d3c4e.jpg) 

In fact, the main reason for this problem is that I did not learn Python introductory knowledge well. By Python introductory knowledge, I mean not only basic knowledge such as lists, but also advanced programming content such as object oriented and process threads. 

This may be because beginners don't know how to lay the foundation, and unfortunately, the selected learning resources do not provide a good understanding of advanced programming, which makes it difficult to learn later. Haste is not enough, so for those who want to learn Python crawlers and other directions, I personally think they should learn the introductory knowledge first. 

Today, I wrote a teaching article about Python advanced programming. After you have learned the basics such as lists, learning the content of this piece will make your progression easier and smoother! 

Let's take a look at what Python advanced programming includes: 

![avatar]( f574d764f2eb44e69d52651a44b0da67.png) 

##  First, object oriented programming 

###  ➿(A) object oriented thinking 

Object-oriented is an abstract programming thinking that is shared by many programming languages. Python is a pure object-oriented language that can be understood as focusing on how to solve problems rather than studying how to implement them. 

Object-oriented and process-oriented are two different ideas. Object-oriented programming languages include Python and other languages, while procedural programming languages include C and other languages. The programming thinking in writing code is different. 

![avatar]( 2755d0fbfca546f5947d684ee270c46a.jpg) 

To understand these two ideas, take laundry as an example. 

>  Washing clothes by hand is generally dry like this: find a basin - put water - add washing powder - soak clothes - scrub - wring out - rinse - wring out - dry.

This is a process-oriented thinking. Once you don't know what to do in the middle, you won't be able to wash your clothes well. For example, if you don't know how to scrub your clothes, you won't be able to wash them cleanly. For example, if you don't wring them out after scrubbing, you can directly dry them, resulting in water on the ground. If a certain link goes wrong, it won't achieve the desired laundry effect. 

>  Washing clothes in the washing machine is generally dry like this: turn on the washing machine - put the clothes in - add washing powder - press the start button - dry.

This is an object oriented thinking. You don't need to know how the washing machine washes after putting the clothes in. You just need to know how to pour the washing powder after putting the clothes in and then press the button. 

![avatar]( 99c16e9b71704c5c8203e1eed9e2d7ed.gif) 

Similarly, in programming languages, the performance is different. When writing code in C language, you have to pay attention to your memory and other low-level things, but when writing code in Python, we rarely pay attention to the low-level things. The focus is on what method to use to solve the problem. 

Before we get into the code, there is a bit of a conceptual thing that needs to be understood. After understanding these basic concepts, we can better enter object oriented programming. 

![avatar]( 8cb26f456d674623a1ba8d6f610deca6.jpg) 

###  ➿Two important concepts of object orientation: classes and objects 

These two concepts may be easier to understand together, and can be simply understood as classes are templates for generating objects. 

We mentioned the example of the washing machine above. If the washing machine is an object, then the blueprint for making this washing machine is a class; if the egg is an object, then the hen is a class; if the dog is an object, then the dog is a class. 

In Python, everything is an object, variables are objects, functions are objects, strings, lists, tuples, and so on are all objects. 

![avatar]( f6ccb90aba4348658e08a648add36add.jpg) 

(1) Composition of objects: object = property + method 

Objects are composed of properties and methods. Properties can be understood as what an object has, and methods can be understood as what an object can do. 

(2) What are the characteristics of the object's properties? 

For example, if a washing machine is an object, then the washing machine has color, and color is an attribute, but color is an abstract thing because it can be red, white, black, and so on. 

For example, if a computer is an object, then the computer has a hard disk, and the hard disk is a property of the computer, so the property of the object can be another object. 

For example, the mouse is an object, the mouse wheel is an object, and the microcontroller inside the mouse is an object. You will find that the large object of the mouse is composed of multiple small objects. 

![avatar]( 572e1018fe2949eda113bf74982286aa.jpg) 

(3) Methods of the object 

There is a rule to understand first. The methods of an object can be called by themselves or by other objects. I will explain in detail later. 

Here we will not talk about code for the time being, because we must first talk about class knowledge in order to better understand the classes and objects in the code, which will be discussed below. 

As mentioned above, a class is a template for generating objects, so a class is an abstraction of an object, and an object is a materialization of a class. 

Since object = property + method, the same is true for class = property + method. 

(1) Create a class 

How to create a class:

 ```  
For example, create a student class and use it to create objects

 ```  
Execution result: 

In fact, when creating an object of the Student class, the following three lines of code can be written as follows, with the same effect:

 ```  
Let's go back and understand what properties and methods are from the perspective of combining code and concepts. 

Class attributes refer to what is in the class. For example, there are name and age in the class, so name and age are attributes of the Student class. 

The class method is what the class can do. For example, the class has the function learn (self), which can execute "the student's learning method has been called", that is, what the class can do, so the function learn (self) is the method of the class.

###  ➿Three characteristics of object oriented 

Three characteristics: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 

1. Objects have clear boundaries, and properties and methods are protected within the boundaries. (security) 

2. The strength of the package is moderate. 

3. Principles of encapsulation

Inheritance is the relationship between a parent class and a child class, such as the dog class and Erha, the dog class is the parent class, and Erha is the child class. 

(1) Define the form (the complete form of the class)

 ```  
Note: Multiple inheritance has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that it enhances scalability. The disadvantage is that it is easy to confuse logic after complex inheritance relationships, making it difficult to understand. It also takes up a lot of resources. For example, the famous diamond inheritance problem mainly involves the MRO and C3 algorithms. If you don't understand, you can Baidu it.

 ```  
(5) Method overloading 

Multiple methods (functions) with the same method name appear, and the method is overloaded by default value in Python. 

![avatar]( 1e813d480ba049e387a2ce3929d55dfd.jpg) 

Polymorphism: A class of things has multiple forms, which is a way of using objects. Subclasses overriding the methods of their parent classes and calling the methods of the same parent class of different subclass objects can produce different effects. 

For example, taking Honor of Kings' selection of heroes as an example, the hero class (Hero) is the parent class, and there is a method called stroke (skill) in the parent class; Cheng Yaojin and descendants are two subclasses, and there is also stroke in the two subclasses; the caller is another parent class, and there is a method to select the hero. The method needs to call the stroke class method, and finally call different subclasses (Cheng Yaojin or descendants) objects to get different skill descriptions.

##  Modules and packages 

###  👳(I) Modules 

Module refers to Python's program files (source files). The file name of the module is the module name plus .py, which contains Python object definitions and Python statements. Module contains defined functions, classes, and executable code, etc. Generally, do not modify the module to avoid module failure. 

In Python, module calls are allowed in the form of imports. Modules in Python are also objects. All global variables defined in a module become attributes of the module after import. 

Syntax 1: import module name 

If you want to import multiple modules, you can use only one import to import multiple modules, separated by commas, but in Python's PEP8 style, this is not recommended, so if you want to import several modules, write several imports to import them one by one. 

Example: Import the math module and call the function of sqrt () to square 9 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Output result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
As a reminder, operations in Python return a float type by default, so it is 3.0. 

Syntax 2: import function 1 from module name, function 2 

Note that the functions here are not followed by parentheses. 

Example: Import the math module and call the function of sqrt () to square 9 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Output result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Syntax 3: import from module name 

Under normal circumstances, this syntax can import all the functions of a module. When you want to use multiple functions of a module, you don't need to write them one by one. I won't give an example here. They are all the same. 

Attention: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Example: (This example requires reading the following custom module to understand) 

A new module called module1 has been created, and the module code has two functions: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Import all the methods in the module using Syntax 3 in another Python file: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
The execution result is only printed out fun1, and then an error is reported, indicating that fun2 () is not defined and cannot be recognized. This is because 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Some modules or function names within the module are relatively long, which is inconvenient when used multiple times. You can customize the name of the module or function. 

1. Module custom alias: import module name as alias 

Example: Customize the time module to alias t and use it. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
After 3 seconds of execution, the program outputs: 

 ```python

 ```  
2. Function custom alias: import function name as alias from module name 

Example: Import the time module and customize the sleep () function to the name s 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
After 5 seconds of execution, the program outputs: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Everyone can generate custom modules to call. Custom modules are Python files, and the Python files created when we write code are equivalent to one module. 

Note: The called module should be placed in the same directory as the current Python file as much as possible, otherwise the folder must be declared before importing. 

Example: Customize a module and call it in another Python file. 

Create a new Python file named module1 with the following code: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Create another Python file in the same directory and call module1.py this module: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Running the current Python file results in: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Each module is executed by default when it is imported, but at the same time there is a lot of dogfooding code inside the module. In order to avoid executing the test code inside the module when importing the module, a method is involved: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
This method can realize a function, if executed in the module, the code of executable code 1 will not be executable code 1 when other files are imported into the module, so the tests inside the general module are placed in the code 1. 

The magic point is that __name__, the result of its execution in the current file is __main__, and the result of execution when other files are imported is the module name, so take advantage of this, use the if statement to determine whether the module is executed in the current file or is imported. 

Example: 

Create a new Python called module1 as a module with the following code: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Create a new Python file and import the module1.py module you just built: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Execution result:

 ```  
The result is different when the current file is executed and when it is imported, so it becomes the dogfooding method of the module. 

Note: In the custom module, it is not recommended to write while cycle, otherwise the while cycle in the module has been executed during the import process, and it may not jump out, that is, the module has been imported, and other code cannot be executed.

Create a new project file in the Pycharm software. After the creation is completed, open Pycharm to create a project folder → click the folder → right-click the pop-up option → New → Python Package → complete the creation. The new folder created is the package, and the init file is automatically created in it. 

![avatar]( 9c11db668a044f929f462dee134c57d5.png) 

There are two main types of conventional import methods. 

Method 1: import package name. module name. target 

Method 2: import package name, subpackage, module name, target 

The targets mentioned here can be variables, functions, and other objects, as will be discussed below. 

Form of use 1: Regular use 1 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Example: Create a package and use it in another .py file, requiring that the .py file not be included in the created package. 

Step 1, open Pycharm to create a new project, create a package, named demo, create a new .py file in the package, named my_module, the code is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Step 2, open another .py file and import the created package 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Form of use 2: Regular use 2 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Example: I will use the demo package created above, modify the code directly in step 2, and use this new way to import the package and use it. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
The execution result is the same. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Usage Form 3: Create another alias and use it 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
In the above usage form 1, some people may find that it is not very convenient to use the imported module, and the package name and module name are required. Can it be simpler? Of course, you can directly give another shortened alias to the module in the package, and then use the alias directly. 

Following the example of using Form 1 above, I will not change Step 1 here. I will directly create another alias in Step 2. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
The result is the same, but using aliases is much more convenient if the code is longer. 

Of course, you can also use Form 2 to import the package and alias it. Just use an alias when using it. I won't give an example of this method. You can try it yourself. 

Usage 4: Import a function 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Here I also use the already created package and use it directly in another .py file. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python

 ```  
Usage 5: Import all functions 

When importing the module, we introduced the import * method to import all the functions in the module. Here, you can also enter all the functions of the module in the import package. 

For example, there is a module called "hhhh" in the package named "demo". The code of the module is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Then we call it in another .py file; 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
6. About all uses 

The use of __all__ has been introduced in the module, which is to control the list of functions that can be imported, but in the package, __all__ is to control the list of modules that can be imported, that is, to declare which modules can be imported. 

__all__ inside a package are declared in __init__ file, not in which module. 

For example, there are multiple modules in a package, and all declared modules can be imported, and those that are not declared cannot be imported. 

Step 1, there are two modules called hhhh and my_module in the package named demo, but in the int file it is declared that only the hhhh file can be used. The code of the int file is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Step 2, import the hhhh and my_module modules in the demo package in the new .py file:

 ```  
Execution result: 

![avatar]( 25dfe63d1afe46d88b875ce537b208ec.png) 

Obviously, although all modules are imported with *, the hhhh modules declared by all can be used, and the my_module modules not declared by all cannot be used and cannot be recognized by the system. 

###  👳(III) The role of modules and packages 

1. Improve the reusability of your code. You are not the only one who can use easy-to-use code, but many people can reuse it. 

2. Improve the readability of the code. If all the code is placed in a .py file, the code will be too long, which increases the difficulty of understanding and maintenance. Therefore, some commonly used code can be packaged into packages and modules, with a literal name, and used directly when needed. This reduces the number of codes and improves readability. 

3. Reduce code redundancy. For some methods encapsulated in the module, we can directly use them for parameters. There is no need to write the methods again, which takes up memory and reduces code redundancy. 

###  👳(Iv) Installation of third-party libraries 

Although Python has many built-in modules and packages, it is not enough to use only built-in modules. After all, built-in modules are limited, and we often use third-party libraries. It is necessary to learn how to install third-party libraries (packages) at this time. 

Today, we will introduce three installation methods for third-party modules and packages. 

You can download and install the third module and package through the package management command pip, provided that the Python you install is installed in the way I mentioned in the article [Python Basics Introduction] earlier, and all options are checked, so that you don't need to configure environment variables. First, check if your pip works. 

>  Method: WIN + R calls up the running window → enter cmd → pip can be used if the following pip information appears 

![avatar]( 2e25d40c315545f694300f3addced1dc.png) 

  If the scarlet letter prompts "pip in cmd is not an internal or external command, nor is it a runnable program or batch file", then you can manually configure the environment variables. If it doesn't work, go back and follow the steps I said to install Python to reinstall it. 

Returning to the question of how pip installs third-party modules and packages, we must first know the name of the third-party modules and packages we want to install, such as Pillow, a third-party library that is a very powerful tool library for processing images in Python. The installation method is: 

 ```python

 ```  
![avatar]( 2c3368f1c2ba4892bd28e63e9decc337.png) 

Sometimes there will be a lot of scarlet letters prompting that the download failed. This is normal. The reason may be: 

>  (1) The .pip version is too low, upgrade the pip version and enter in the black window: python -m pip install -U pip 

>  (2) The network is not good, just download it a few more times. 

Installing via pip doesn't require opening the software, but we can also install via Pycharm as follows: 

>  Click File → Settings → Project: Project Name → Python interpreter → Click + → Enter the name of the package you want to install, select the one you like → Click Install Package → Wait for download and installation

 ![avatar]( 2ce4335cce9c4063951ed37487d2b805.png) 

You can search and download the package you want through the official website and other channels. Official website: https://pypi.org/, search for the third-party library you want to download, such as the library Pillow, and search directly: 

![avatar]( 6fc855aaee5542d280ac9835bb1106d7.png) 

Then select the file you want to download, such as Pillow 8.3.2, enter the download page, and click Download files.

 ![avatar]( 9649a983309d406ba533bee70152e544.png) 

  There are many versions and models after entering. It is recommended to choose the version that matches you, otherwise it may not be installed. Pay attention to the number of Python versions, systems and computers here. For example, my Python is installed 3.9.6, so I placed the file Pillow - 8.3.2 - cp39 - cp39 - win_amd64. Whl. After downloading, WIN + R opens the command line and enters CMD. Enter the file name under the pip install file path in the black window. For example, the path I stored after downloading is D:\ Google Chrome, so the code I entered in the black window is:

 ```  
Then enter to install and wait for the installation to complete.

##  III. Document processing 

###  💼(I) Definition and operation of the document 

Computer files usually refer to the collection of information stored on the computer's hard disk as a carrier, mainly in the form of video, audio, pictures, and documents, such as executable files.exe, document file.txt, web file.html, and so on. 

![avatar]( fa8b9443bedc46acab1a7623bdf75635.jpg) 

###  💼(2) Basic operation of the document 

In reality, our operations on files can be roughly summarized as "open → operate (read, delete, modify, etc.) → save → close", which is still the case in Python. Before starting file operations in Python, let's learn a few methods. 

1.open (name, mode) ---- Open file 

This is the Python method of opening a file, which is used to open a file and return a file object. 

Name refers to the file name, which must be written in full. What is written in full? It is to write clearly, storage path + file name + suffix. 

Why do you need to write so much? Because even under the same storage path, there may be more than one file with the same file name. As long as the suffix is different, the computer allows the existence of files with the same name, so if you don't write it all, the computer doesn't know who you are referring to 

Mode is the mode to open the file. The default is r, which is the read-only mode. There are many modes of mode, such as reading, writing, etc., which we will talk about later. 

2. write ("content ") ------ write 

As the name suggests, it is to write content to the file object. 

3.read () ------- read 

To write content to the file, you can write numbers in parentheses or not. If you don't write, the default is to read the entire content. Writing numbers means reading X characters. For example, read (6) reads 6 characters of the file object. 

4. close () ------ close the file 

The method of closing the file, if you do not close the file after the file operation, the file will always be open and operated on, which will consume memory. 

5. Cases 

After understanding these 4 basic methods, let's start with a small case: create a new project, then create a Python file named "file" for writing code, and then we write "hello world" to a .txt file called "file 1" by writing. The code is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
As mentioned earlier, the open () method returns a file object, so let's use f to receive it. This is the pre-run interface: 

![avatar]( d64a8cb2968b4ab58c15f0fbe2932ff9.png) 

After running: 

![avatar]( 55c5386c2faa4583a1b32ff4bae272c7.png) 

After running, a new file named "File 1.txt" is generated, and after opening it, we can see what we entered. When writing, if the file does not exist, one will be created by default. 

Similarly, we can also perform read operations on this file: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
This is the most basic file operation process. 

It should be noted here that when open (name, mode) is written at the beginning, mode already determines what operations you can do, that is, if you start writing code with: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Then if you want to write () later, an error will be reported, because the r read-only mode is declared in mode, so you do not have write permission. Please pay attention to this. 

6. other modes of operation 

There are many operation modes in mode, let's take a look at them in a table: 

The pointer can be understood as a cursor here. Where it is, your operation begins. 

For example, create a new .txt file named "test", write aaa to it for the first time, and write bbb to it for the second time.

##  IV. Abnormal 

###  ⚡(I) Definition of an exception 

An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and affects the normal execution of the program. In general, an exception occurs when Python cannot handle the program properly. 

For example, I only wrote one variable a in the code, and when I run the program, pycharm cannot recognize this variable, so an error is reported, indicating an exception. 

![avatar]( 8adc7d465fbd4c0bb2e8ceea29f1a878.png) 

###  ⚡(2) Handling of exceptions 

Therefore, we need to master the methods of handling exceptions. There are many ways to handle exceptions. Let's take a look at them one by one. 

It can process the code that may be wrong, and the red font that reports an error after processing will be converted into a short, normal font, which is used as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Example: Direct printing of variable a will generate an error. 

![avatar]( 6c531a7ed4c843c6b2460d778fc0246c.png) 

After tyr-except processing: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run it again to see the effect: 

![avatar]( 468ad28097274201a57c698debd24f06.png) 

The red error message has become shorter and the color is normal. Does this abnormality seem more comfortable? 

Here, tyr-except does not affect the execution of the code. If your code does not report an error, even if you write tyr-except, it will only execute the try line of code. If there is no error in that line of code, it will not execute the code inside except. 

For example, let's take a normal one: 

![avatar]( 9e011e9756a545d8b5644cbbf33c853a.png) 

This method is similar to the previous try-except writing method, except that an except is added later, which can be used to determine a variety of possible error situations. 

For example, there are two lines of code that might report an error, two different types of exceptions, but don't want it to go viral. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

![avatar]( 5b766e0b98924f0abdc82426c29abaee.png) 

Although the error is reported, there is no red. Here, pay attention to the two ways of writing except. 

The try-except writing method is very flexible. We can also use tuples to include exception types that may report errors to avoid writing multiple lines of except, for example: 

![avatar]( 70ff6fd15fe5432db08b0e8ba3ec6205.png) 

If there is no exception, execute the code in else, for example: 

![avatar]( b5048b15d48440da8180452e195a8d67.png) 

No matter whether the code has an exception or not, the code in finally will be executed at the end. For example: 

![avatar]( f310461c763648de917ff645cd8d1d2a.png) 

In fact, you can not add the error type after except, because the system will default that the error behind is of type Exception, which is a top-level class that contains all error types. 

![avatar]( 4cb0a47e6ae14b8781ea9af7bed1ab65.png) 

###  ⚡(III) Custom exceptions 

Have you found that when we went to do basic exception capture earlier, we had to write a try-except every time there was a possibility of error. What if there were multiple possible errors? Do we need to write multiple try-except? Or theoretically, the code can run, but I want to set a rule that any behavior that does not meet my rules will cause an exception. For example, if the password length exceeds the length specified by me, I want the program to cause an exception. 

Custom exceptions can be used to raise an exception (throw an exception), which is raised by the keyword raise. 

For example, to simulate the situation where a user enters a password, the password entered by the user cannot be less than 6 digits. Customize an exception to detect whether the password entered by the user meets the regulations. If it does not meet the requirements, an exception will be raised, indicating that the current password length and minimum password length cannot be less than 6 digits.

 ```  
Run result: 

![avatar]( f0f44fd55d2642c7ab58374a3b2dfc21.gif) 

From the above code, we have used the knowledge of classes and instance objects in the previous object oriented section. If you forget it, please review it quickly. In addition, we also combine the previous try-except and our keyword raise to cause exception capture. 

##  V. Regular expressions 

###  ✈️(A) re-module 

Before we talk about regular expressions, we must first know where to use regular expressions. Regular expressions are used in the findall () method, and most string retrievals can be done through findall (). 

1. Import the re module. Before using the regular expression, you need to import the re module. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
2. the syntax of findall (): 

After importing the re module, you can use the findall () method, so we must be clear about the syntax of findall (). 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
It is not difficult to see that findall () is composed of a regular expression and a target string. The target string is what you want to retrieve, so how to retrieve it is performed through a regular expression, which is our focus today. 

The result returned after using findall () is a list of strings that meet the regularization requirements 

###  ✈️(2) Regular expressions 

(1) Ordinary characters, most letters and characters can be matched by themselves.

 ```  
(2) Metacharacter 

Metacharacters refer to special characters such as .^ $ ?+ {} \ [], through which we can personalize the search of the target string and return the result we want. 

Here I will introduce to you 10 commonly used metacharacters and their usage. Here I will give you a simple summary for easy memorization. The following will explain the use of each metacharacter one by one.

There are other flexible ways to write {m, n}, such as: 

Regarding the commonly used metacharacters and how to use them, let's take a look at the other knowledge of regular rules. 

###  ✈️(3) The use of regular rules 

In Python, the re module can compile regulars through the compile () method, re.compile (regular expression), for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Output result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
The use of regular objects is not only through the findall () method we introduced earlier, but also through other methods. The effect is different. Here is a simple summary: 

(1) findall () finds all strings that re match and returns a list 

(2) search () scans the string to find the position where the re matches (just the first one found) 

(3) match () determines whether re is at the beginning of the string (matches the beginning of the line) 

Let's take the example of the object returned by compile () after compiling the regular. Instead of findall (), let's use match () to see how the result is: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Output:

 ```  
It can be seen that the result is a match object, the starting subscript position is 0~ 13, and the match is 010-123456789. Since the object is returned, let's talk about some operation methods of this match object. 

Here are the methods first, and I will give examples later. Common methods of using Match objects are as follows: 

(1) group () returns the re-matched string 

(2) start () returns the starting position of the match 

(3) end () returns the position where the match ends 

(4) span () returns the position of a tuple: (start, end) 

Example: Use span () to operate on the object returned by search ():

 ```  
In addition to the findall () function introduced above, there are other functions in the re module to provide an introduction: 

(1) findall () returns all the strings that match according to the regular expression. I won't say much about this. I have introduced it earlier. 

(2) sub (regular, new string, original string) The function of sub () is to replace the string, for example:

##  Process thread 

###  🔰(1) Multitasking operating system 

The operating system can perform multiple tasks, such as our Windows system. In addition to the few tasks currently being performed that you can see, there are also many tasks being performed in the background. You can use the Ctrl + Alt + Del keys to call up the task manager and take a look. 

![avatar]( 596d59cae7044c06a4df3b00fe1f9039.png) 

My computer configuration often sees the properties of a processor with several cores. For example, my computer has 12 cores, which means that the computer can execute up to 12 tasks simultaneously and run up to 12 processes simultaneously. 

![avatar]( 4c762a939ece4a0e919b019bb37a3195.png) 

But why are our computers capable of running hundreds of tasks simultaneously? 

![avatar]( dc814973184d439bb2b7278bcf0cf0ff.png) 

In fact, this is due to the task scheduling of the operating system, most operating systems are scheduled in the form of preemptive time slices. The system switches between multiple tasks very quickly in an extremely small amount of time. For example, an 8-core operating system can theoretically only execute 8 tasks at the same time within 1 second, but the system may switch between hundreds of tasks within 1 second, A task executes, B task executes, C task executes... As a result, many tasks can be executed within 1 second, resulting in hundreds of tasks that are visible to the naked eye being executed all the time. 

The term is "macroscopic parallelism, microscopic serialization," and in fact computers can only perform no more tasks than the number of cores configured in extreme time, and 8 cores can only perform 8 tasks. 

![avatar]( 53ae334ced4440d082f1e17ea70225a3.jpg) 

Since we talk about tasks, a process is a task, and a process is equivalent to a task, which is the smallest unit of resources allocated by the operating system. In Python, you can use a process to achieve multitasking, and a process is a way to achieve multitasking. 

The multiple subtasks of a process are called threads. Threads are the smallest unit of execution of a process. A process can have many threads, and each thread performs different tasks. 

![avatar]( 819fc84886574ed08f067480bb5d3cda.jpg) 

Python supports both multiple processes and multiple threads. Next, we will start to learn about Python's processes and threads. 

###  🔰 (2) Python's multiprocessing (package) 

If you use multiple processes, your Python code is executed line by line from start to finish, which is essentially executing one process, which should be well understood. 

To make more use of CPU resources, we can make use of multiprocessing. Here is a Python multiprocessing package that is commonly used in multiprocessing. It has many functions, such as child processes, communication, sharing, and execution of different forms. Let's learn about some commonly used ones. 

Process is a process class in multiprocessing, through which multiple processes can be realized. Let's take a look at its usage first, and we will have practical examples to describe it later. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
There are many methods in Process, the most common of which is the start () method to start the process. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
For example, the code written is as follows. I want to see the effect of calling functions with and without multiple processes enabled. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
When multiple processes are not started, the execution effect is as follows: 

![avatar]( e44d56851d28415f9f3a3725c0473fb6.gif) 

As you can see, this is a very normal running situation. The program runs from top to bottom, line by line. If the three loops in music () are not completed, they will not execute the movie (). If these two functions are not completed, they will not execute the last line of print ("The main process has completed execution"). 

Let's take a look at adding multiple processes to the code in the above case: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Code I added an if statement to determine __name__ this, why? Because in the Windows system, multiprocessing this package will occur recursive phenomenon, that is, will be repeatedly executed between "import module - call module", do not believe you can remove the if statement, put all the code inside the outside to execute will report an error, this is a phenomenon that will occur under the Windows system, mac, linux and other systems do not need to add ifl to judge. 

About __name__ = "main" this knowledge point I have talked about in the initialization of modules and packages, if you don't understand, you can go back and take a look. 

Run effect: 

![avatar]( 9adfbde4ada8429cb6365b3b92d16c8c.gif) 

It can be seen that after the process is started, there are three processes running at the same time when the code is running. One is the main process that executes from top to bottom, and the output "The main process is completed" is executed below. The other two child processes execute the music () and movie () processes. Judging from their execution speed, they are running at the same time, so they don't have to wait for the code in one of the functions to execute three times before starting the second function. 

The same code, your execution effect may be different from mine, because the effect is randomly assigned according to the current state of the system, but it does not affect the fact that you can see that its result is multi-threading. 

Finally, let me add that we mentioned earlier that there are args and kwargs in Process that can be passed as parameters. Args are passed as general parameters, and kwargs are passed as parameters in the form of dictionaries. Let's take the above code as an example to pass more parameters. 

![avatar]( 4faa568f48a84f9ca6c5ee4ccb984e0b.png) 

We mentioned earlier that there are multiple processes performing tasks at the same time when the code is executed, so how to check the number of the current process to know which processes are currently running? Which are the main processes and which are child processes? There are three methods. Let's take a look at the methods first, and then use them together with examples. 

(1) Get the number of the current process: 

You need to use the getpid () method in the os module, which is used as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
(2) Get the name of the current process 

Here is still the multiprocessing package, which has a current_process () method, the usage is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
(3) Get the number of the current parent process (main process) 

Which parent process does the child process belong to? This uses the getppid () in the os module, and the usage is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
![avatar]( 17c59d2259a143d691c7b0ca8804e0eb.jpg) 

Then we have seen the method. Based on the example just now, let's get and print the name, number, and number of the parent process of the current process. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

![avatar]( 266b9c6c438b491ca45829a4e740d3c2.gif) 

The number and name can be printed as long as we use the get thread method. 

###  🔰 (3) Multithreaded Threading Module 

Multiple processes can run several tasks simultaneously. As we mentioned earlier, the smallest unit of a process is a thread, so threads can also perform multiple tasks. If a process has only one task (the main process), then it can be said that there is only one thread. For example, when we do not use multiple processes to run code, we can say that there is one main process or one main thread. 

A commonly used module for multi-threading is threading, which has a class that teaches Thread. It is similar to the Process class we used for multi-process. Let's take a look at the usage first: 

 ```python

 ```  
Similarly, multiple threads also need to be enabled, similar to the previous one. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
There is also a way to get the thread name: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
With these knowledge points in mind, let's start with an example: using a similar example to the one above to use our multithreading. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
It can be seen that our multi-threading is actually similar to multi-process, and it can also run multiple tasks. Here we also increase the use of parameters.

In addition to using the above methods to implement multi-threaded tasks, we can also use inherited classes to implement multi-threading. 

Example: multithreaded to print "cool" and "hair gone." 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
The MyThread class is created by ourselves, which inherits from the parent class threading. Thread. At the same time, we need to write the initialization method of MyThread, and do a good job of preparation every time it is called. We have also talked about this, and we have talked about it in the previous object oriented. If you don't understand, you can look at the content of the object oriented article. 

Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
There are random effects. Your effects may be different from mine. When each computer runs multi-threaded code, whichever thread can grab the time slice will execute first. 

Multithreading can also be achieved through inheritance from the class Thread. 

##  Seven, containers/iterators/generators 

###  🚩 (I) Container 

In Python, a container is a data structure that organizes multiple elements together, and the elements in the container can be obtained one by one iteratively. To put it bluntly, its function is just like its name: to store things (data). 

The container does not actually exist. It is not a data type, but an artificial concept. It is just a concept word created for the convenience of learning. It can use the membership operator (in or not in) to determine whether the object is in the container. 

Of course, it wasn't created by me, I don't have that much ability, it was officially created, well, don't worry, I'm teaching you some weird nouns, and no one will understand it when you say it... It's called that in python. 

![avatar]( 4e65de7e7d4f41eba25846e6ef57e294.jpg) 

Common container types include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and sets. 

Since the data in the container can be obtained iteratively, we have to learn a new concept: iterable objects. 

###  🚩 (2) Iterable objects 

What is an iterable object? 

In Python, an iterable object doesn't refer to a specific data type, it refers to a container object that stores elements. 

That is to say, if there is no data stored in the container, it is not an iterable object, and not all containers are iterable objects. Containers contain but are not limited to iterable objects. 

Pay attention to two points: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Have you ever thought about how the for loop is implemented internally? For example, in this example of a for loop, why can every element in the list be output? How is it implemented internally? 

![avatar]( b9a028d2f0454756b484ffe84a77aed8.png) 

In fact, the loop does two things: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Then we don't need a for loop to output each element in the list, 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Output result: 

![avatar]( a93739168dcb443a916dc1db33f9371f.png) 

It can be seen that if we remove the line of code that prints ite, the execution effect is the same as each element in the output list of the for loop. The for loop defines the range 4 times, and actually executes 1 __iter__ () and 4 __next__ (), that is to say, the essence of the for loop accessing the iterative object is achieved through this. 

Moreover, the two things that the for loop essentially does are indispensable, that is to say, if there is no __iter__ () to return the iterator first, __next () __ cannot get the element, which just shows the second point of the two points mentioned above: an iterable object cannot be iterated independently. 

There are two built-in functions that have the same principle as them and are essentially the same. It is more convenient to use built-in functions if you want to use them, at least you don't need to write so many underscores: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
![avatar]( 2fc205b9d56e48858355262021fb2e33.png) 

It can be seen that the result is exactly the same. Since iterators are mentioned, let's take a look at what an iterator is. 

![avatar]( 511a9cb2757f46879097683afe530fd4.jpg) 

###  🚩 (III) Iterator 

From the example of the for loop above, we can probably see that, 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Since this is the case, when we learned the basics of Python, we said that range () is an iterable object, so it can also generate an iterator by __iter__ (). 

![avatar]( d71df4ed7b2048f68c209a8a306bfe92.png) 

###  🚩 (Iv) Sequence 

Sequence is also an abstract concept, which includes lists, tuples, and strings. It does not exist in itself, and is also a concept created for learning. 

Iterable objects contain sequences, and since sequences contain lists, tuples, and strings, as in our previous example, sequences can be used by iter () and next (). 

Sequences can be divided into finite sequences and infinite sequences. Finite sequences have a range, for example, range (10) has defined the range, on the contrary, infinite sequences are sequences without a limited range. 

We need to generate an infinite sequence. Here, we need to use a new module, itertools, which is a collection of iterative functions for efficient loops. It has a method count () below it, which can generate an iterator without range, which can be understood as an infinite iterator. 

![avatar]( 9fdbeb032c7c4ef69f03b4769ba78be3.png) 

From this example, we can see that as long as it is executed once, next () will fetch the contents of the iterator once and retrieve them one by one. I have only written four next () here, and you will output a few more times if you write more. 

A mechanism like next () that needs to be called when is called lazy loading mechanism, also known as lazy loading; 

On the contrary, there is hungry loading. For example, the for loop will fetch all the objects in the iterator as soon as it is executed. 

###  🚩 (5) List derivation 

List derivation is related to the generator. Before talking about the generator, you need to know what a list derivation is. A list derivation is a method of generating a list. The syntax is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
I represents the object to be placed in the list, and the for loop is an expression. 

For example, let's use a list derivation to generate a list. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Using list derivation can easily generate the list we want. 

And there's lots of other flexible uses of it, like conditional judgment. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
If the following condition is determined to be true, the list can be generated normally. If it is false, the list derivation is invalid. At this time, l will be an empty list. 

There are other flexible uses, such as manipulating the previous i, such as doubling the value of i: 

![avatar]( 474e4417244c4665bef84250e73e54e4.png) 

We replace the iteration object with a string, which can also be output, but * represents the repeating operator in the string, so the effect becomes like this: 

![avatar]( 07b3e0047f2b4077a4ce120d75691783.png) 

Not only that, but we can also use functions to operate the previous i * 2, such as: 

![avatar]( 1639088b00854f39ac6102409066b1de.png) 

Overall, list derivations are a flexible way to quickly and customize the generation of lists. 

Then someone may draw inferences. List derivations are all operated with [], so if you use () to operate, will it generate a tuple? Let's take a look: 

![avatar]( 5e0763154370477bb3c97164bd8ee3f8.png) 

[] 换成（）之后，返回的是一个生成器generrator ，那么下面我们再来讲讲生成器： 

###  🚩 (6) Generator 

Generators are objects that actually exist in Python, unlike containers, which can be called directly through next (). 

The first creation method is similar to the list derivation, that is, [] is replaced by (): 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
For example, let's generate a generator and see if we can call it directly with next (): 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
It can be seen that the generator can be called directly. So since the generator can be called by next (), then the generator is a special iterator, an iterable object. 

In addition to creating a generator in the above method, you can also create it with yield as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
For example, let's create a generator with a function containing yield: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
The result is a generator, and at this point the function fun () is no longer a function, it is a generator, and as long as yield appears in the function, the function becomes a generator. 

Why doesn't the while loop keep executing? Don't worry, let's output it: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
I called it three times, so it ran three times. The while loop exists, but it doesn't work because of the lazy loading we mentioned earlier. 

When you need it, when you use the next () call, it is lazy loading, unlike hungry loading, which generates all objects in advance. If you replace it with a for loop to complete, for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
After running the program will enter an infinite loop, has been to add 1 to a, you can try to see the effect, that is, hungry Han type loading generates an iterator in advance and calls all iterator objects, hungry Han type loading takes up resources magnifying glass.

Finally, a diagram summarizes their relationship:

##  Eight, modifier 

###  🏁 (1) The concept and role of modifiers 

A decorator, also known as a decorator, is itself a function that adds additional functionality to an existing function or method. 

In summary, the role of a decorator is to add additional functionality to an existing object. 

For example, this function is a registered function, but sometimes when the user performs this operation, he is a registered user. I have already written this function and don't want to move it. Then we can add a login function to this function through a decorator. 

It is often used in scenarios with tangential requirements, such as: insert log, performance testing, transaction processing, caching, permission verification, etc. Decorators are an excellent design to solve such problems. With decorators, we can extract a lot of identical code that has nothing to do with the function itself and continue to reuse. 

![avatar]( 52fee12ad3ed4d0890da2e167b585f5d.jpg) 

The specific operation of the decorator, let's learn it slowly. 

###  🏁(Ii) The use of modifiers 

Before using decorators, we need to remember a few instructions for using them: 

(1) The keyword for a decorator is @. As long as it appears in Python code, you can think of it as a decorator. 

(2) Decorators modify functions or methods and cannot modify a class. 

(3) The decorator must appear on the previous line of the function or method being modified, and cannot be defined on the same side of the function. 

Example: 

![avatar]( a55667c8f5854d77a533af9c4ddb0fe4.png) 

Although the decorator itself is a function, its appearance is regulated. The above decorator does not appear in the first line of the modified function or method, so even the print ("Uncle Dragon") line of code cannot be executed. 

(4) The decorator itself is a function that passes the modified function as a parameter to the decorator, performs the functions in the decorator, returns the passed function object, and calls the returned function. 

These points are important, and let's deepen our understanding by exploring the various uses of decorators. 

![avatar]( 36009dafc7d84ffdaf10bfadf96d75b5.jpg) 

If the modified function is not called, the function following @is executed, and the modified function is passed as a parameter, then the return value of the decorator function can be any value. 

Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
First of all, we can see that this is a very simple example of using a decorator, using @dec to call the dec () decorator function, while the modified function funA () does nothing. 

Secondly, we can see that the modified function funA () does not call anything, but it is passed as an argument to the decorator function dec (), so dec () needs a parameter to accept the passed value. I used a as a parameter. If you remove a, the system will report an error, because the value returned by the modified function funA () is not accepted. You can try it. 

Finally, there is one more point, the modified function funA () has not been called, have you noticed? So the decorator function dec () returns anything, the above returns None, you can return a "sick", you can return anything, let's look at the situation where the modified function funA () is called. 

![avatar]( fd5b2f6dd50b4ab1bc121b0c379db8b7.jpg) 

If the modified function is called, execute the decorator directly and pass the modified function to the decorator as a parameter, but the return value of the decorator must be the current parameter.

 ```python

 ```  
There is an error, saying that string str cannot be iterated, why? In fact, the reason is that when a decorator exists and is used, the modified function is called again. At this time, the return value cannot be any value. At this time, the decorator function can only return the passed value. You can try to change the return "sick" to return a to output normally, or you can remove the line of code funA () and do not call the Hughes function, the output is normal. 

 ```python

 ```  
Everything is normal. 

Let's take a look at the execution logic of the decorator again: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363

 ```  
From this running result, we can see that the modifier's running logic is: the modified function funA () is called, but it is not directly executed, but directly executes the modifier dec, and passes the modified function funA () as a parameter to the modifier dec, executes the code in the modifier function dec (), returns the code in the modified function funA () that is executed after passing the value a, and finally finishes the modified function funA () before executing the remaining code. 

I'll use a more sketchy diagram to illustrate this: 

![avatar]( 3da35bef75ab42c5ac3a02f6f8bdbc36.png) 

We talked about the basic uses of decorators earlier. There are many ways to use decorators, and you can also use function nesting. 

Let me demonstrate with a simple example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python

 ```  
From the running results, function nesting can also be carried out in the modified function. 

Closures are also a type of function, but they are relatively special. I will not repeat the knowledge about closures here. In [Python Basics], we have talked about closures. If you forget, you can take a look or Baidu. Let's take a look at how closures in modifiers are used. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result:

 ```  
It can be seen that closures can also be used normally in decorator functions. 

![avatar]( 92eed7881d6d44dcadb8f04775ff8825.jpg) 

If the modified function has parameters passed, the parameters can only be passed to the embedded functions in the decorator function.

It can be seen that although the modified function C () passes parameters to the decorator function A (), the default pass is still the object C (), the decorator function A () accepts the modified function C (), and the parameters are passed to the function B () in the decorator function A (). 

Even if you add two parameters to A (), it will not accept it and will only report an error. We have already said in the instructions for the use of the decorator, "The modified function is passed to the decorator as a parameter", so the decorator function accepts only the object of the modified function. If you want to pass parameters, then there must be other functions in the decorator function to accept the passed parameters. 

If the decorator has parameters but the modified function has no parameters, you can only use the inline function to collect the parameters.

###  🏁(III) Python's built-in decorators 

The previous ones we talked about are all our custom decorators. In Python, there are built-in decorators. Let's learn about three common Python built-in decorators: staticmethod, classmethod, and property. 

Their function is to transform the methods in the class into static methods, including class attributes and class methods of the class. Let's take a brief look at the specific use. 

Property can change a method into a property. The modified method name must be the same as the method name below the property. Property can only be used for private properties. 

Let's make a comparison. We create a class and use the methods in the class without using properties, as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result:

 ```  
No problem, it works fine, so let's try it with the built-in decorator property to see what's different. 

Before using the built-in decorator property, we have to add a point: private properties, properties created inside the function are private properties, and cannot be used outside the function without special treatment. Private properties are represented by two underscores in front of them. For example, the __name in the class represents private properties. Let's take a look at a simple example: 

![avatar]( d688fd8ef22f4eb2ae0c3d5abf61bee8.png) 

It can be seen that private attributes can be accessed within the class, but not externally (they can be accessed after some processing, which will not be introduced here. You can check it online). 

Returning to our built-in decorator properties, in the previous example where we did not use properties, we made a modification to add the built-in decorator properties. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
From this example, we can see that the built-in decorator property can be used for private properties, and methods can be turned into properties. For example, a.age is calling properties instead of methods. Although age () appears many times in the class, it does not report an error because of method coverage. It is also because of the existence of property that the property stipulates that the modified method name must be the same as the method name below the property. 

![avatar]( a3a4a683012f4576ab60b8b2b5bd7f6b.jpg) 

The built-in decorator staticmethod is a static method whose function is to remove the modified method from the class and become an independent function, which cannot access the properties of the class. 

Let's write a simple class first and compare it with staticmethod without using it 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
Run result:

 ```  
There is no problem with this. Let's take a look at using the staticmethod and add it directly: 

![avatar]( b3cfd203de7f464cb13b13d7bbc5bdac.png) 

The reason for the error is that after adding @staticmethod, the eat () method becomes an ordinary function. Although its position is in the class, it is actually equivalent to an ordinary function, not a class method. Therefore, you have to pass a value to it, otherwise the parameter self will not be passed and the error will be reported. 

The correct writing should be: 

![avatar]( b67ef6dcacb7404ebe62a0211bd7fe9b.png) 

Let's summarize this staticmethod: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363
 ```  
The difference between a method decorated with classmethod and an instance method is that the first parameter received is not self, but cls (the concrete type of the current class). The modified method cannot access instance properties, but can access class properties. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574529363

 ```  
From the results, it can be seen that from the objects printed by sleep () and eat (), the object passed by sleep () is the instance object b created, while the function eaten () modified by the decorator passes the class; from the point of view of eating () accessing the properties and instance properties of the class, there is no problem accessing the properties of the class, but an error is reported when accessing the properties of the instance object. 

Therefore, it is verified that the method modified by classmethod is different from the instance method in that the first parameter received is not self, but cls (the specific type of the current class). The modified method cannot access the instance properties, but it can access the class properties.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I originally didn't like playing games, but recently my brother had something to do and put his grandson at my house for us to help take care of. My little nephew loves to play games very much. He is in his early sixties and seventies, and he stares at Honor of Kings every day, which is really a headache. 

Then I thought of a way to use Python to change the game of Xiaoxiao, add a layer of Honor of Kings "skin", confiscate his phone, and let him play this game that can slightly exercise his intelligence. 

![avatar]( 3f51ea6e535e432bbf2faf2a1989957b.png) 

These games are written in Python. I used to collect some games. I don't think the middle setting is very good, so I changed it according to my personal preference. I will share it with you today. If you have nothing to do, you can play for entertainment. Or if you want to make small games, you can refer to them. 

There is a network disk link at the end of the article, which can be picked up by yourself if necessary. 

###  The Honor of Kings 

Like the usual Xiaoxiao, three identical patterns can be eliminated together, and as much as possible, more identical patterns can be eliminated within the specified time to get a higher score. 

![avatar]( 1015f6b0712f43c4b6c8db77b67dee8d.gif) 

To be honest, I play this game with my grandnephew, but I really can't play him, his eyes are too sharp. 

###  Gobang 

Xiaoxiao Le, I can't play him, so I made a special one that I am good at, Gobang, I started playing this thing when I was ten years old, and this little brat has never won with me, hahaha. 

![avatar]( 3098f54bd1f9403da77af9d0ede260da.gif) 

###  III. Tank War 

Tank Wars was a classic old game that could be played by two people together. The only drawback was that when they designed it, they always felt that the shells hit the wall strangely, but they didn't want to fix it. 

![avatar]( 9a9cf8603ebf4693a817d1e4246ea927.gif) 

###  Fourth, eat peas 

The rules of this game were that players could clear the level by eating all the yellow Doudou without being caught by the ghosts of the system. Although the ghosts of the system looked stupid, to be honest, I couldn't pass the first level, but that little brat could. 

![avatar]( 78db3c1885f94c0eaa6780728bd4cd6e.gif) 

###  Fifth, Google Dinosaur 

This game is to imitate the little dinosaur game that appears when the Chrome browser is disconnected from the network. Through the space bar to control the forward dinosaur, it will fail to encounter flying objects or plants. The more plants and flying objects the little dinosaur avoids, the higher the score. 

![avatar]( 1a7c0709f970421d9ea4dcd512bee74e.gif) 

###  The game source code needs to be picked up by yourself: 

Link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1it1eizZJrLWfsZeRCJJn8w 

Extraction code: lg8d 

My little nephew stayed at my house for a week, and every night when I had nothing to do, I would take him to play this game. At first, he was quite stubborn when he was not allowed to play mobile games. After playing Python games with me, he became attached to me. In fact, I did not simply ask him to change from one game to another, but when he became familiar with the game, I would simply share some of the internal principles of the game with him. 

Of course, he doesn't understand the code, and I won't tell him the code. I just tell him how the game is designed and what some essential things are, so that he doesn't get fascinated by the shell of the game. 

![avatar]( fe911e4b4d284c2291e63a3df109aa44.jpg) 

And I came home one day, and this guy actually opened up my computer, found the source files, and he was secretly changing the parameters because he wanted to make the game easier.

Many people think that by learning several parsing libraries such as the urlib module and xpath, they will become proficient in crawling after learning Selenium, but when they go outside and want to rely on crawling technology to connect privately, they find it difficult to do anything. 

Uncle Long, I have been a programmer for nearly 20 years, and today I will tell you what a real crawler master should learn. Even if you have no foundation, you can still know how to learn. 

![avatar]( 51b81f7643204c48bbf5598127e7ef29.jpeg) 

Without further ado, let's get straight to the point. 

###  1. Language basics Python 

There are many tools that can be used to make crawlers, but the most convenient language in the industry is Python. So if you want to learn Python to learn crawlers, how much should you learn? 

Here are some essential Python knowledge points for you. You don't need to learn more or less. Basically, you can get it done in a week or two. 

![avatar]( 0ab70f55b732493bbadd8a417fdfae56.png) 

###  2. Crawler basics and common modules 

After the language foundation is laid, we can officially enter the learning of crawlers. 

The first thing you should learn is the basics of crawlers, such as: 

With a general understanding of crawlers, you can start learning from the commonly used modules. Urllib and request are two modules that crawlers must learn, such as refer and status code. You need to know what status your program requests return, whether it succeeds or fails. 

In this part, you should learn how to make your program simulate user actions and automatically send requests to websites or other objects, which is more basic. 

Why is it very basic? Because many websites are validated, it is necessary to learn Selenium, a very commonly used tool that simulates artificial browser behavior, which is effective in verification. 

![avatar]( da534843e0dd4592aaf8bc8b0cd1f61a.jpeg) 

###  3. Analysis library 

After learning to simulate user behavior and send requests to crawler objects, we must learn to parse what we get, otherwise we will get a bunch of garbled characters, and Jesus will be confused when he sees it. 

![avatar]( 88f79128cacd402bb60aaea9664aca64.jpeg) 

  So what are the things that the parsing library needs to master? These are very important: 

###  4. Scrapy framework 

What is a framework? It is equivalent to a structure that encapsulates many functions. It helps us build the main structure, and we only need to add content to the skeleton. 

Scrapy framework is a framework for crawling website data and extracting data. We are familiar with the four major parts of crawlers, including request, response, parsing, and storage. The scrapy framework has been established. 

So what does Scrapy need to learn? 

![avatar]( 3f21bbd0ca5d464fbf9da5949cd40ab8.jpeg) 

 After learning to use the framework, the crawler can save a lot of time without having to write all the functions by hand. Why not?  

###  5. Databases 

For a master crawler, a database is also a must. If it is an enterprise crawler, you know the data you crawl down, but if you want to call it for others, it is mostly sorted out and stored in the database for easy access. 

So what do you need to learn about databases? Whether it is SQL or NOSQL database, at least you need to know one, either MySQL or MongoDB, depending on your situation. 

![avatar]( b3ccdb245a9b422e8ad4002ec0987f6f.jpeg) 

###  6. Mobile end crawler 

Many small partners stop at only crawling web data, and are helpless about mobile data. This is actually a typical crawling technology that has not yet arrived. 

![avatar]( e2aea2e2df114b84b188b7a5620292a9.jpeg) 

  So what do mobile end crawlers need to learn? Let me list it for you: 

![avatar]( 65ef9f85b4da4dc2a06d08c01446a55d.png) 

###  7. Improvement of crawler technology 

If you know the previous techniques, you can handle at least 60% of the crawler objects, but with the continuous improvement of the anti-crawler mechanism, many crawler objects now give themselves multiple city walls, so the difference between ordinary crawlers and crawler masters lies in high-end technology. 

If you want to become a master crawler, you also need to learn the following aspects: 

If the same IP frequently crawls the specified object, it will most likely be detected as a crawler, so IP proxies and coding platforms must be able to do so. 

Nowadays, CAPTCHAs are increasingly testing IQ, so we also need to master this area, such as speed algorithms, OpenCV, and behavioral verification technologies. 

![avatar]( 33cd93dc7bc44b4e88cbb8a0ab33553c.png) 

What is font anti-crawling? 

Simply put, font anti-crawl refers to the characters on the browser page and the content in the debugging window or source code, which are displayed differently, which is font anti-crawl. 

The complex point is that web developers create a font by themselves, because each text in the font has its own code, so the final effect of the text will not be directly displayed in the web page in the future, but its code name will be displayed, so even if the text content in the web page is obtained, it is only the code name of the text, not the text itself. 

Therefore, this technology can also be used as a direction for improvement. 

For the sake of data security, modern websites/apps usually encrypt data interfaces. The process of analyzing the encryption algorithms of these interfaces and implementing simulated calls is called reverse. 

Reverse is a topic that can never be avoided for crawler engineers, and it has gradually become a must-have skill requirement in JD when recruiting companies. 

###  Conclusion 

Finally, let me summarize all the techniques mentioned in the article, which are listed in the following crawler learning roadmap: 

![avatar]( a3176b6de4ff42ddb491922b826e32d7.png) 

  If you can learn more than 90% of the technology stacks mentioned above, then you can become a master crawler. 

Technology is innocent, but behavior can be sentenced. I hope everyone can use it on the right path after mastering the real technology.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Novices are prone to get stuck when writing code, especially when they come into contact with functions and other knowledge. They often don't know what method to use to implement it after reading the requirements. You may have the implementation logic, but you should forget what function to use. This is actually because the reserve of knowledge is not enough. You can't remember which function has any effect, so you are naturally confused. 

In the past few days, I have specially sorted out some commonly used functions in Python, from the most basic input and output functions to 12 sections such as regularization, a total of more than 100 commonly used functions, which is convenient for friends to quickly memorize, go through it quickly every day, and deepen it when using it. Slowly, you will get rid of the situation of writing code stuck. 

Although we emphasize more on understanding and actually typing code when teaching ourselves to program, there are some things you must keep in mind, otherwise you will be unable to write code. Of course, veterans have already memorized it. If a novice wants to develop quickly and easily, it is a good way to remember the functions used in high frequency.

After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574537484
 ```  
All the functions mentioned in the article have been organized into pictures. There are 6 of them. If necessary, you can chat with me privately. I will not repeat them here to increase the length of the article. The content is the same. You can also organize your own function notes. When we don't have a network or have a lot of favorites, as long as we have a mobile phone, we can access them without barriers, which is very convenient.

###  Conclusion 

The purpose of this article is not to teach you how to use functions, but to quickly and conveniently remember commonly used function names. Therefore, I did not give you an example of the usage of each function. Only after you have memorized the function name and its function will you have a clue. As for the usage of functions, Baidu will come out at once, and you will know it after a few uses. 

If you don't even know the name of the function and its purpose, you will have to spend more time and effort, and it will certainly be faster than if we look up the information with purpose. 

I can't help but think of 2010 when Python became the most popular language of the year, I started to learn Python (I used to use the main Java), just the function will remember dozens of pages of the book, commute to get off work are with me, take out the time to go through it quickly, and then have a colleague after work to eat supper and drink some wine, from the ground to the sky, the package is gone, the book is lost, the next day I regret... can only write a new one.

 To be honest, Python is a lot of fun, and it's not that cold anymore.  



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some people can't get in after learning Python for two or three months, while others can start their own projects in about a month. When I was a beginner in Python, it only took me more than a month to become familiar with crawlers and data analytics. Of course, I am an old programmer, so I can learn other languages faster. 

Therefore, I will use some of my experiences and resources to share with you the pits I have fallen into, hoping that you can step over them. 

Let me share with you six useful things, some of which are my own tutorials and routes, and some are collectible video tutorials. With them, your Python journey will be easier and more enjoyable. 

Let me introduce how to use these things first, and take them away at the end of the article. 

![avatar]( 46e26ad5f7e54cc1957d39f5b79193c4.jpg) 

(1) The learning path in all directions of Python (new version) 

This is where I spent a few days sorting out the technical points in all directions of Python to form a summary of knowledge points in various fields. Its usefulness is that you can follow the above knowledge points to find corresponding learning resources to ensure that you learn more comprehensively. 

Recently, I have made a new update to these routes, and the knowledge system is more comprehensive. 

![avatar]( 8fc093dcfa1f476694c574db1242c05b.png) 

 ​​ 

(2) Python learning videos 

It contains more than 100 learning videos on Python beginners, crawlers, data analytics, and web development. Although it is not as comprehensive, it is no problem for beginners. After learning these, you can follow my learning route to find other knowledge resources online to advance. 

![avatar]( d66e3ad5592f4cdcb197de0dc0438ec5.png) 

(3) More than 100 practice projects 

When we watch videos to learn, we can't just use our eyes and brains without doing anything. The more scientific learning method is to use them after understanding. At this time, the practice project is very suitable, but there are many projects in it, and the level is also uneven. You can choose the projects you can do to practice. 

![avatar]( f5aeb4050ab547cf90b1a028d1aacb1d.png) 

(4) More than 200 e-books. Over the years, I have also collected a lot of e-books, probably more than 200. Sometimes it is inconvenient to bring physical books, so I will open the e-books to have a look. Books are not necessarily worse than video tutorials, especially authoritative technical books. 

Basically, there are both mainstream and classic ones. I will not put pictures here. There is no problem with copyright issues. 

(5) Summary of Python knowledge points 

The summary of knowledge points is a bit like a learning route, but the difference from the learning route is that the summary of knowledge points is more detailed, including a simple description of specific knowledge points, while our learning route is more abstract and simple, just to make it easier for everyone to learn which technology stacks you should learn in a certain field. 

![avatar]( c741a91b05a542ba9dc8abf2f2f4b1af.png) 

(6) Other information 

There are also some other things, such as my own Python introductory graphic tutorial, which allows me to learn knowledge without a computer, learn theory and then go to code practice verification, as well as the Chinese version of Python library materials, MySQL and HTML tags, etc. These are all things that can be given to fans. 

![avatar]( 9fa77af248b84885a6ec779b2ead064d.png) 

These are not very valuable things, but they are really good for learners who do not have resources or are not very good. If you use them, you can just take them away. Anyone who has followed me knows that these are all available.

Many people can't do anything after learning Python for two or three months, but some people can start their own projects or private work after learning it for less than a month. Why is this? 

![avatar]( fa6f3d73ecdc4ce8855302c20537797a.jpeg) 

As a 20-year-old programmer, Uncle Long, I think that in addition to internal reasons, learning resources occupy the majority. Having good learning resources can indeed save you a lot of detours on the road to learning. 

So today, I will hand over all my private resources and corresponding learning methods to you, for nothing else, just give me a like if you pass by, thank you! 

I will talk about resources and learning methods first, and I will leave the way I picked up the dry goods at the end of the article. 

I spent a long time sorting out the technical points required by various Python positions on the market, and combined with my nearly 20 years of coding career, I have summarized the technical stacks that should be learned in various directions such as Python crawlers and data analytics. 

I think this is very important. If you know how to proceed from the beginning, you will avoid many detours along the way. 

![avatar]( 8aa10f149878478dafa446260e974d23.png) 

For example, in the case of crawlers, many people think that they are proficient in Python crawlers after learning several parsing libraries such as xpath and PyQuery. In fact, there is still a long way to go, such as mobile end crawlers and JS reverse. 

![avatar]( 1359dda4a04e49c393a026ee6c4ca6c3.png) 

Contains Python introductory, crawling, data analytics and web development learning videos, a total of more than 100, although not up to the boss level, but proficiency in Python is no problem, after learning these, you can follow my learning route to find other knowledge resources online for advanced.

Basically, there are both mainstream and classic ones. I will not put pictures here. There is no problem with copyright issues. 

There are other things, such as my own Python introductory graphic tutorial, which is different from other people's articles. My graphic tutorial will be more interesting, and sometimes you may laugh out loud when you look at it. When it is inconvenient to watch videos, you can also learn Python by reading books. 

![avatar]( 9904ecf499c14ec5b2fa2ada0dc80b64.png) 

I've always wanted to make learning programming more enjoyable. 

These are not very valuable things, but they are really good for learners who do not have resources or are not very good. If you use them, you can just take them away. Anyone who has followed me knows that these are all available. 

###  How to take it away? 

The way to take it away is below:

Some people learn Python for two or three months, but they can't even get in, while others start working on projects in about a month. The reason for such a big contrast is that learning resources actually account for a large factor. 

Don't be foolish about learning online. I have also updated some resources recently. As long as you are my fan, you can take away this benefit. 

Let me introduce how to use these things first, and take them away at the end of the article.

A few days ago, I went to a friend's company to do technical guidance, and I found a very interesting thing. Their IDLEs are all thieves. According to them, writing code in this way doesn't have to stare at some letters, numbers, and symbols all day, and it's no longer so boring. As a developer for more than ten years, IDLE has always used the default interface of the system, which really makes me feel ashamed after a closer look. 

I went back and thought about it. I think I can write an article to share with you. The IDLE of these developers is really interesting. I asked them to take a few representative interface diagrams. Let's take a look at what their pycharm looks like. 

So here's an example. 

![avatar]( 20210702205420906.png) 

 Here's another one. 

![avatar]( 20210702205438305.png) 

 I heard that it is a relatively popular anime in China. I have never seen it. I rarely go to anime, and I don't like to watch it very much. 

The IDLE background of a female programmer in their company has also changed, which I guess may have been motivated by them. 

![avatar]( 2021070220545252.png) 

 Among them, I have seen the most special one. He said it was his girlfriend. I took a look at his appearance and background. The little sister didn't speak. In fact, I was skeptical: 

![avatar]( 20210705141442138.png) 

It's really interesting to change the style of IDLE, but their style is still not suitable for me. At my age, I may prefer some artistic things, which may seem a bit low in everyone's eyes, but I think it's okay. 

![avatar]( 20210705140208774.png) 

Next, I will share with you how to change the background of your pycharm, and three steps will make your IDLE unique. 

##  First, the operation steps 

The first step is to open pycharm, click File, and select Settings. 

![avatar]( 2021070514021961.png) 

In the second step, click Appearance in the Appearance & Behavior option, and click Background Image. 

![avatar]( 20210705140239529.png) 

The third step is to click on the "..." place in the upper right corner, and you can choose the picture you want to use as the background. After confirming, choose the display method you like. I think the second method is still good. 

![avatar]( 20210705140256716.png) 

The last thing is to set the brightness of the background image. I suggest that the brighter background should be about the same at 10% transparency. If it is too bright, it will affect the code, personal preference and picture color.

I don't know if you have noticed when crawling data with crawlers. More and more websites have their own anti-crawling mechanisms, and crawling data is not as easy as it used to be. The current common anti-crawling mechanisms mainly include the following: 

>  Data is dynamically loaded, such as Weibo, Jinri Toutiao, Bilibili need to log in, require a verification code, such as railway 12306, Taobao, JD.com frequent requests, Internet Protocol Address too many visits at the same time, resulting in IP being blocked Data shielding method, such as the accessed data is not in the source code, the data is hidden in js, such as Share Today, Bilibili 

Reptiles and anti-reptiles have always been like left and right hands. If you have an anti-climbing mechanism, I have anti-climbing technology. You can climb when you see it, and the road is one foot high. 

![avatar]( 13b8035817084fa6b4c4160576cd1016.jpeg) 

Today, we will introduce the anti-crawling mechanism and practical countermeasures of the website in detail. Generally, websites are anti-crawling from three aspects: 

1. User request headers 2. User behavior 3. Website directory and data loading method 

The first two are easier to encounter, and most websites are anti-crawling from these angles. The third type is used by some websites that apply Ajax, which increases the difficulty of crawling (to prevent static crawlers from using Ajax technology to dynamically load pages). 

![avatar]( c8d16562f13e44edaf6ec3e6167a05b7.jpeg) 

This is the most common anti-crawler mechanism. When visiting certain websites, websites usually use a header file to identify whether the visit is a crawler, as a strategy for anti-crawler. 

Then we need to disguise headers. Many websites will detect the User-Agent of Headers, and some websites will detect Referers (the anti-theft chain of some resource websites is to detect Referers). 

![avatar]( b16ab9e11fd44479a78417b371f058ac.jpeg) 

If you encounter such anti-crawling mechanisms, you can directly add headers to the crawler, copy the browser's User-Agent into the crawler's headers, or modify the Referer value to the target website domain name. 

It is often overlooked. Through the packet capture analysis of the request, the referer is determined, and the access request header is simulated in the program. 

For anti-crawlers that detect headers, modifying or adding headers to the crawler can be easily bypassed. 

For example, open the Sohu homepage, first take a look at the header information of the Chrome (F12 opens the developer mode) as follows: 

![avatar]( eb1d2158cf78fb1c6c6adce238ed956e.png) 

As shown in the figure, the access header information shows the browser and system information (headers contain a lot of information, among which User-Agent is an identifier of the user's browser identity, which can be queried by yourself). 

The request module in urllib in Python provides the function of simulating browser access. The code is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574538525
 ```  
Access can be requested by add_header (key, value) or directly with the URL as a parameter 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574538525
 ```  
Where headers is a dictionary, in this way the crawler can be simulated as a browser to access the website. 

![avatar]( 3b03de2bb9584759a474b5e06d5d4cce.jpeg) 

There are also some websites that detect user behavior, such as multiple visits to the same page by the same IP in a short period of time, or the same account performing the same operation multiple times in a short period of time. 

This kind of anti-creep requires enough IP to deal with it. 

Most websites are in the former case. In this case, it can be solved by using an IP proxy. You can write a crawler specifically to crawl the public proxy IPs on the Internet, and save them all after detection. With a large number of proxy IPs, you can change the IP every few times a request, which is easy to do in requests or urllib, so that you can easily bypass the first anti-crawler. 

![avatar]( daf7bac260f145088c2a3f6e0414e40d.jpeg) 

Write a crawler proxy: 

Steps: 

>  1. The parameter is a dictionary {'type': 'proxy ip: port number'} proxy_support = urllib.request. ProxyHandler ({}) 2. Customize, create an opener opener = urllib.request. build_opener (proxy_support) 3. Install opener urllib.request. install_opener (opener) 4. Call opener opener.open (url) 

Use a large number of proxies to randomly request target websites and deal with anti-crawlers 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574538525
 ```  
For the second case, the next request can be made at random intervals of a few seconds after each request. Some websites with logical vulnerabilities can bypass the restriction that the same account cannot make the same request multiple times in a short period of time by requesting several times, logging out, logging in again, and continuing the request. 

Anti-crawl restrictions on accounts are generally difficult to deal with, and random requests for a few seconds may often be blocked. If you can have multiple accounts, switching to use is more effective. 

![avatar]( 20210625191729446.jpg) 

Most of the above situations appear on static pages, and there are some websites where the data we need to crawl is obtained through Ajax requests or generated through Java. 

Solution: Selenium + PhantomJS 

Selenium: Automated web testing solution that fully simulates the real browser environment and essentially all user actions 

PhantomJS: A browser without a graphical interface 

For example, obtain Taobao's personal details address: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574538525
 ```  
![avatar]( aa46484c478e4be8b12671455ca3531b.jpeg) 

Finally, let me summarize the anti-climbing mechanism and coping strategies mentioned earlier: 

Finally, let me tell everyone that the reptile world is indeed very interesting. Technology is innocent, and learning is OK, but the actual operation is enough, and do not touch the boundaries of the law.

##  Python basics (a full set of nanny-level tutorials) 

###  Chapter One 

![avatar]( 86a2bfd0069f4326bfefd6fd1f77336a.jpeg) 

1. What is programming? It is easy to understand. Programming is the use of code to write programs. There are many ways to write programs, such as C language, Java Python language, and many other languages. 

![avatar]( 7171a7cc057b46c09140ad303b0d660c.jpeg) 

  2. What is a programming language? A programming language is a language for writing programs, and which syntax rules are used to write programs. Then, many programming prefaces need our programmers' hands to type them out one by one. For example, "a = 10" Imagine, 'a = 10' is something we humans know, but to turn it into something the computer knows, the computer knows the '01 'code! This problem arises, we need to convert what we know into '01' code and hand it over to the machine to execute. At this time, it is divided into two categories of programming languages: 

The first category: compile type (c, go): compile type is to translate the program you wrote into 01 code at one time, compile type is characterized by high execution efficiency, like you play League of Legends (Lol), Dungeons and Warriors (Dnf) are basically compiled language to write (c language), so c language is also a typical compile type, do you want to play lol in the Linux, shouting Demacia with Galen, not no, it is very troublesome, so compile type also has a feature of his platform dependence is very high 

![avatar]( a209b6131d45424d81667edad3b6d89d.jpeg) 

 The second category: interpretive (java, python): interpretive is just the opposite of the compiled type, translating and running the source code line by line, you can send the code you wrote directly to your customers, your customers can directly execute your program with software, you think about it. You send the code you wrote directly to your customers. When your customers run, they need to translate line by line, translate line by line, and run line by line. At this time, the execution efficiency is relatively low. Therefore, the characteristic of interpretive is that the execution efficiency is relatively low, and the platform dependence is not high. 3. What is python, the advantages and disadvantages of python. Python's past life originated from the originator "Uncle Turtle". In 1989, Guido van Rossum decided to develop a new script interpreter in Amsterdam to pass the boring Christmas. Since then, Python and its founder "Uncle Turtle" have entered the public eye. He hopes that this new language, called Python, will meet his ideal: to create a language between C and shell, with comprehensive functions, easy to learn, easy to use, and extensible. Chinese translation: Python, his Chinese translation should not be torn. Python has nothing to do with python. It is just a random start by foreigners, and they can do whatever they want. Python language is old, but only in recent years, with the emergence of artificial intelligence and data analytics big data platforms, python has become popular with its unique advantages. It is a scripting language. It is very good for processing data, writing a crawler, and writing some small functions. It is particularly easy to get started, especially easy, and the third library is particularly comprehensive. So as people's demand for the era of big data has increased one by one in recent years, python has also risen with the tide, and it has become a big hit. Python's characteristics: crawler, automation (automated office, automated operation and maintenance) scientific computing artificial intelligence 

Python is an object-oriented, interpreted, and weakly typed scripting language, and it is also a powerful and well-developed general-purpose language.

Summary The for loop wants to count. It must be counted by means of range range (n): count from 0 to n. Does not contain n range (m, n): count from m to n, does not contain n range (m, n, s): count from m to n, does not contain n, the interval each time is s Usually used more for loops, while loops use more infinite loops

  Python official link: https://www.python.org/Find Downloads All releases of python released all versions are in it, this is to ask you whether you want to download the latest version of python This article recommends not to use the latest version of the python interpreter, there may be some problems, do not rush to use the latest version, the latest is not necessarily the best, the most stable is the best. 

![avatar]( 6e420a0ebfd94d458c3bd29be9a6bc50.png) 

  For different versions corresponding to different downloads, see what system you are on. 

The installation follows the diagram step by step. Path must be ticked. The path is too deep and difficult to find, so choose the following custom path. The path is concise and do not write Chinese.

  After the installation is completed, enter cmd into win + r, and type python as shown in the figure. As shown in the figure, the installation is successful. 

![avatar]( 68d65827b77e4fafae7a6c745f5ec9e7.png) 

  If it shows the following, 99%, your path is not checked. The solution is to open the advanced properties of the system (no Baidu), add your python path to the path, and follow the picture.

 In the last lesson, we talked about opening the python interpreter and entering python. At this time, we can write code. Print (") This is the meaning of print. What you write will output. But think about it, if we want to write something every time we have to type it again, and if we want to run your code again, we have to reopen cmd and re-enter it. You can type 3 lines, 30 lines and 30,000 lines. You must not cry, so you have to save it in the file at this time. We can create a new text document on the desktop and file. If you haven't taken the computer test, just follow my picture, open my computer, find View, click the option in the upper right corner, click View, and uncheck the extension that hides known file types.

 Create a new text document and change the suffix to .py. Enter the content you want to type. Enter a python in front, and then drag the file directly into it, and you can execute it, but if you enter the wrong content in the file, the file will not remind you, so in the next lesson I will tell you a "The best power builder in the universe"

 Foreword, sometimes you write an algorithm and wring your brain for three days and three nights. After writing it, you go out to relax. You are likely to forget how the code you just rewrote is implemented. The algorithm you wrote is ruthless. If you can't explain it to others, others will doubt whether the code was written by you. If you are a programmer, when you leave the company, you have to hand over tasks. The code you write is likely to be written in one or two years. You have long forgotten how it was implemented, so you can't explain it clearly to the handover person. The real boss's comments are very complete. A complete code comment may be more than the code. Therefore, you need to be able to understand the code yourself, and others should be able to understand it. Then how to write comments? "Multiple lines ””” ‘‘‘ multiple lines"
